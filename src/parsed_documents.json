A key problem in the design of good algorithms for this problem is that formulas for the variance may involve sums of squares, which can lead to \n numerical instability as well as to \n arithmetic overflow when dealing with large values.\n \n \n  I. Na\u00efve algorithm \n \n \n The \n formula for calculating the variance of an entire \n population of size n is:\n \n \n \n \n \\sigma^2 = \\displaystyle\\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^2/n}{n}. \\!\n \n \n The formula for calculating an \n unbiased estimate of the population variance from a finite \n sample of n observations is:\n \n \n \n \n s^2 = \\displaystyle\\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^2/n}{n-1}. \\!\n \n \n Therefore a naive algorithm to calculate the estimated variance is given by the following \n pseudocode: \n \n \n n = 0\n sum = 0\n sum_sqr = 0\n \n \n foreach x in data:\n n = n + 1\n sum = sum + x\n sum_sqr = sum_sqr + x*x\n end for\n \n \n mean = sum/n\n variance = (sum_sqr - sum*mean)/(n - 1)\n \n \n This algorithm can easily be adapted to compute the variance of a finite population: simply divide by n instead of n  minus; 1 on the last line.\n \n \n Because sum_sqr and sum * mean can be very similar numbers, the \n precision of the result can be much less than the inherent precision of the \n floating-point arithmetic used to perform the computation.  This is particularly bad if the variance is small relative to the sum of the numbers.\n \n \n \n \n  II. Two-pass algorithm \n \n \n An alternate approach, using a different formula for the variance, is given by the following pseudocode:\n \n \n n = 0\n sum1 = 0\n foreach x in data:\n n = n + 1\n sum1 = sum1 + x\n end for\n mean = sum1/n\n \n \n sum2 = 0\n foreach x in data:\n sum2 = sum2 + (x - mean)^2\n end for\n variance = sum2/(n - 1)\n \n \n This algorithm is often more numerically reliable than the na\u00efve \n algorithm I for large sets of data, although it can be worse if much of the data is very close to but not precisely equal to the mean and some are quite far away from it.\n \n \n The results of both of these simple algorithms (I and II) can depend inordinately on the ordering of the data and can give poor results for very large data sets due to repeated roundoff error in the accumulation of the sums. Techniques such as \n compensated summation can be used to combat this error to a degree.\n \n \n \n  IIa. Compensated variant \n \n \n The compensated-summation version of the algorithm above reads:\n \n \n n = 0\n sum1 = 0\n foreach x in data:\n n = n + 1\n sum1 = sum1 + x\n end for\n mean = sum1/n\n \n \n sum2 = 0\n sumc = 0\n foreach x in data:\n sum2 = sum2 + (x - mean)^2\n sumc = sumc + (x - mean)\n end for\n variance = (sum2 - sumc^2/n)/(n - 1)\n \n \n \n \n \n  III. On-line algorithm \n \n \n It is often useful to be able to compute the variance in a single pass, inspecting each value x_i only once; for example, when the data are being collected without enough storage to keep all the values, or when costs of memory access dominate those of computation.  For such an \n online algorithm, a \n recurrence relation is required between quantities from which the required statistics can be calculated in a numerically stable fashion.\n \n \n The following formulas can be used to update the \n mean and (estimated) variance of the sequence, for an additional element x_{\\mathrm{new}}. Here, m denotes the estimate of the population mean(using the sample mean), s2n-1 the estimate of the population variance, s2n the estimate of the sample variance, and n the number of elements in the sequence before the addition.\n \n \n \n \n m_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\frac{n \\; m_{\\mathrm{old}} + x_{\\mathrm{new}}}{n+1} = m_{\\mathrm{old}} + \\frac{x_{\\mathrm{new}} - m_{\\mathrm{old}}}{n+1} \\!\n \n \n \n \n s^2_{\\mathrm{n-1, new}} = \\frac{(n-1) \\; s^2_{\\mathrm{n-1, old}} + (x_{\\mathrm{new}} - m_{\\mathrm{new}}) \\, (x_{\\mathrm{new}} - m_{\\mathrm{old}})}{n} \\; \\; \\, \\,  \\; \\,     \\mathrm{n gt;0} \\!\n \n \n \n \n s^2_{\\mathrm{n, new}} = \\frac{n \\; s^2_{\\mathrm{n, old}} + (x_{\\mathrm{new}} - m_{\\mathrm{new}}) \\, (x_{\\mathrm{new}} - m_{\\mathrm{old}})}{n+1}.\n \n \n It turns out that a more suitable quantity for updating is the sum of squares of differences from the (current) mean, \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - m)^2, here denoted M_2:\n \n \n \n \n M_\\mathrm{2,new}\\! = M_\\mathrm{2,old} + (x_\\mathrm{new} - m_\\mathrm{old})(x_\\mathrm{new} - m_\\mathrm{new})\n \n :s^2_\\mathrm{n} = \\frac{M_2}{n}\n \n \n s^2_\\mathrm{n-1} = \\frac{M_2}{n-1}\n \n \n A numerically stable algorithm is given below.  It also computes the mean.\n This algorithm is due to Knuth,1\n who cites Welford.2\n \n \n n = 0\n mean = 0\n M2 = 0\n \n \n foreach x in data:\n n = n + 1\n delta = x - mean\n mean = mean + delta/n\n M2 = M2 + delta*(x - mean)      // This expression uses the new value of mean\n end for\n \n \n variance_n = M2/n\n variance = M2/(n - 1)\n \n \n This algorithm is much less prone to loss of precision due to massive cancellation, but might not be as efficient because of the division operation inside the loop.  For a particularly robust two-pass algorithm for computing the variance, first compute and subtract an estimate of the mean, and then use this algorithm on the residuals.\n \n \n A slightly more convenient form allows one to calculate the standard deviation without having to explicitly calculate the new mean. If n is the number of elements in the sequence after the addition of the new element, then one has\n \n \n s^2_{\\mathrm{n-1, new}} = \\frac{(n-2)s^2_{\\mathrm{n-1, old}}+\\frac{n-1}{n}\\left(x_\\text{new}-m_\\text{old}\\right)^2}{n-1}\n \n \n \n \n  IV. Weighted incremental algorithm \n \n \n When the observations are weighted, West (1979) 3 suggests this incremental algorithm:\n \n \n n = 0\n foreach x in the data:\n if n=0 then \n n = 1\n mean = x\n S = 0\n sumweight = weight\n else\n n = n + 1\n temp = weight + sumweight\n S = S + sumweight*weight*(x-mean)^2 / temp\n mean = mean + (x-mean)*weight / temp\n sumweight = temp\n end if\n end for\n Variance = S * n / ((n-1) * sumweight)  // if sample is the population, omit n/(n-1)\n \n \n \n \n  V. Parallel algorithm \n \n \n Chan et al.4 note that the above on-line algorithm III is a special case of an algorithm that works for any partition of the sample X into sets X^A, X^B:\n \n \n \\delta\\! = m^B - m^A\n \n :m^X = m^A + \\delta\\cdot\\frac{N^B}{N^X}\n \n \n M_2^X = M_2^A + M_2^B + \\delta^2\\cdot\\frac{N^A N^B}{N^X}.\n \n This may be useful when, for example, multiple processing units may be assigned to discrete parts of the input.\n \n \n \n  Higher-order statistics \n \n \n Terriberry5 extends Chan's formulae to calculating the third and fourth \n central moments, needed for example when estimating \n skewness and \n kurtosis:\n \n \n M_3^X = M_3^A + M_3^B + \\delta^3\\frac{N^A N^B (N^A - N^B)}{(N^X)^2} + 3\\delta\\frac{N^AM_2^B - N^BM_2^A}{N^X}\n \n :\\begin{align}\n M_4^X = M_4^A + M_4^B   + \\delta^4\\frac{N^A N^B \\left((N^A)^2 - N^A N^B + (N^B)^2\\right)}{(N^X)^3} \\\\\n                       + 6\\delta^2\\frac{(N^A)^2 M_2^B + (N^B)^2 M_2^A}{(N^X)^2} + 4\\delta\\frac{N^AM_3^B - N^BM_3^A}{N^X} \\\\\n \\end{align}\n \n \n Here the M_k are again the sums of powers of differences from the mean \\Sigma(x - \\overline{x})^k, giving\n \n \n skewness: g_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{n} M_3}{M_2^{3/2}},\n \n :kurtosis: g_2 = \\frac{n M_4}{M_2^2}.\n \n \n For the incremental case (i.e., B = \\{x\\}), this simplifies to:\n \n \n \\delta\\! = x - m\n \n :m' = m + \\frac{\\delta}{n}\n \n \n M_2' = M_2 + \\delta^2 \\frac{ n-1}{n}\n \n :M_3' = M_3 + \\delta^3 \\frac{ (n - 1) (n - 2)}{n^2} - \\frac{3\\delta M_2}{n}\n \n \n M_4' = M_4 + \\frac{\\delta^4 (n - 1) (n^2 - 3n + 3)}{n^3} + \\frac{6\\delta^2 M_2}{n^2} - \\frac{4\\delta M_3}{n}\n \n \n It should be noted that by preserving the value \\delta / n, only one division operation is needed and thus that the higher-order statistics can be calculated for little incremental cost.\n \n \n \n \n \n  Example \n \n \n Assume that all floating point operations use the standard \n IEEE 754 double-precision arithmetic. Consider the sample (4, 7, 13, 16) from an infinite population. Based on this sample, the estimated population mean is 10, and the unbiased estimate of population variance is 30.  Both Algorithm I and Algorithm II compute these values correctly.  Next consider the sample (108 + 4, 108 + 7, 108 + 13, 108 + 16), which gives rise to the same estimated variance as the first sample.  Algorithm II computes this variance estimate correctly, but Algorithm I returns 29.333333333333332 instead of 30.  While this loss of precision may be tolerable and viewed as a minor flaw of Algorithm I, it is easy to find data that reveal a major flaw in the naive algorithm: Take the sample to be (109 + 4, 109 + 7, 109 + 13, 109 + 16).  Again the estimated population variance of 30 is computed correctly by Algorithm II, but the naive algorithm now computes it as  minus;170.66666666666666.  This is a serious problem with Algorithm I, since the variance can, by definition, never be negative.\n \n \n \n \n  See also \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Computational formula for the variance\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  References \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Donald E.

Source: \n USDA Nutrient database\n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Almond (Prunus dulcis, \n syn. Prunus amygdalus Batsch., Amygdalus communis L., Amygdalus dulcis Mill.) is a species of \n Prunus belonging to the subfamily \n Prunoideae of the family \n Rosaceae; within Prunus, it is classified in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by the corrugated seed shell. An almond is also the \n seed of this tree. Botanically, the almond seed or fruit is not a true \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n nut\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n , but a \n drupe.1\n \n \n \n Description\n \n \n The almond is native to \n \n Iran\n , from northwestern \n \n Saudi Arabia\n , north through western \n \n Jordan\n , \n \n Israel\n , \n \n Lebanon\n , western \n \n Syria\n , to southern \n Turkey.2 It is a small \n deciduous \n tree, growing to between 4 and 10 meters in height, with a trunk of up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The young shoots are green at first, becoming purplish\n    where exposed to sunlight, then grey in their second year. The \n leaves are 1 cm long and 1.2\u20134 cm broad, with a serrated margin and a 2.5 cm \n petiole. The \n flowers are white or pale pink, 3\u20135 cm diameter with five petals, produced singly or in pairs before the leaves in early spring.34\n \n \n The \n fruit is a \n drupe 3.5\u20136 cm long, with a downy outer coat. The outer covering or \n exocarp, (fleshy in other members of Prunus such as the \n plum and \n cherry), is instead a leathery grey-green coating called the hull, which contains inside a hard shell, and the edible seed, commonly called a \n nut in culinary terms. Generally, one seed is present, but occasionally there are two. In botanical terms, an almond is not a \n true nut. The reticulated hard woody shell (like the outside of a peach pit) surrounding the edible seed is called the \n endocarp. The fruit is mature in the autumn, 7\u20138 months after flowering.34\n \n \n \n \n Origin and history\n \n \n The wild form of domesticated almond grows in parts of the \n Levant; almonds must first have been taken into cultivation in this region. The fruit of the wild forms contains the \n glycoside \n amygdalin, \"which becomes transformed into deadly prussic acid (\n hydrogen cyanide) after crushing, chewing, or any other injury to the seed.\"5 Before cultivation and domestication occurred, wild almonds were harvested as food and doubtless were processed by \n leaching or roasting to remove their toxicity.\n \n \n \n \n \n Unripe almond on tree\n \n \n \n However, domesticated almonds are not toxic; \n \n \n Jared Diamond\n \n  argues that a common genetic mutation causes an absence of glycoside amygdalin, and this mutant was grown by early farmers, \"at first unintentionally in the garbage heaps and later intentionally in their orchards\".6 Zohary and Hopf believe that almonds were one of the earliest domesticated fruit-trees due to \"the ability of the grower to raise attractive almonds from seed. Thus, in spite of the fact that this plant does not lend itself to propagation from suckers or from cuttings, it could have been domesticated even before the introduction of \n grafting\".5 Domesticated almonds appear in the \n Early Bronze Age (3000\u20132000 BC) of the Near East, or possibly a little earlier. A well-known archaeological example of almond is the fruits found in \n Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt (c. 1325 BC), probably imported from the Levant.5 The domesticated form can be found as far north as \n \n \n \n Iceland\n \n \n 7 although the official distribution of the plant in \n Europe shows the most northerly country to be \n \n Germany\n .8\n \n \n Almond is called Lawz in \n Arabic and Baadaam in \n \n Hindi\n  , \n \n Gujarati\n , \n \n Turkish\n , \n \n Urdu\n , and \n \n Persian\n .\n \n \n \n \n Production\n \n \n \n \n \n An almond shaker before and during a harvest of a tree\n \n \n \n Global production of almonds is around 1.7 million tonnes, with a low of 1 million tonnes in 1995 and a peak of 1.85 million tonnes in 2002 according to \n Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) figures.9 According to the FAO, world production of almonds was 1.76 million tonnes in 2006. Major producers are the USA (715623 t, 41%), Spain (220000 t, 13%), Syria (119648 t, 7%), Italy (112796 t, 6%), Iran (108677 t, 6%) and Morocco (83000 t, 5%). Algeria, Tunisia and Greece each account for 3%, Turkey, Lebanon and China each account for 2%.10 In \n Turkey, most of the production comes from the \n Datca peninsula. In Spain, numerous commercial cultivars of sweet almond are produced, most notably the Jordan almond (imported from \n M\u00e1laga) and the \n Valencia almond. In the United States, production is concentrated in \n \n California\n , with almonds being California's sixth leading agricultural product and its top agricultural export.

(July 2008)''\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Flowering almond tree\n \n \n \n There are two forms of the plant, one (often with white flowers) producing \n sweet almonds, and the other (often with pink flowers) producing \n bitter almonds. The kernel of the former contains a fixed oil and emulsion. As late as the early 20th century the oil was used internally in medicine, with the stipulation that it must not be adulterated with that of the bitter almond; it remains fairly popular in \n alternative medicine, particularly as a \n carrier oil in \n aromatherapy, but has fallen out of prescription among doctors. \n \n \n The bitter almond is rather broader and shorter than the sweet almond, and contains about 50% of the fixed oil which also occurs in sweet almonds. It also contains the enzyme \n emulsin which, in the presence of water, acts on a \n soluble \n glucoside, \n amygdalin, yielding \n glucose, \n cyanide and the \n essential oil of bitter almonds, which is nearly pure \n benzaldehyde. Bitter almonds may yield from 4\u20139mg of \n hydrogen cyanide per almond.1213 Extract of bitter almond was once used medicinally, but even in small doses effects are severe and in larger doses can be deadly; the cyanide must be removed before consumption.14\n \n \n \n \n Culinary uses\n \n \n \n \n \n \n shelled (left) and unshelled (right) almonds\n \n \n \n While the almond is most often eaten on its own, raw or toasted, it is used in some dishes.  It, along with other nuts, is often sprinkled over desserts, particularly sundaes and other ice cream based dishes.  It is also used in making \n baklava and \n nougat. There is also \n almond butter, a spread similar to \n peanut butter, popular with peanut \n allergy sufferers and for its less salty taste. The young, developing fruit of the almond tree can also be eaten as a whole (\"green almonds\"), when it is still green and fleshy on the outside, and the inner shell has not yet hardened. The fruit is somewhat sour, and is available only from mid April to mid June; pickling or brining extends the fruit's shelf life.  A popular snack in parts of the Middle East, they're eaten dipped in salt to balance the sour taste. \n \n \n The sweet almond itself contains practically no \n carbohydrates and may therefore be made into flour for cakes and cookies for low carbohydrate diets or for patients suffering from \n diabetes mellitus or any other form of \n glycosuria.  Almond flour is \n gluten free and therefore a popular ingredient in cookery in place of wheat flour for gluten-sensitive people, and people with \n wheat allergies and \n coeliac disease. \n \n \n A standard serving of almond flour, 1 cup, contains 20 grams of carbohydrates, of which 10 g is \n dietary fibre, for a net of 10 g of carbohydrate per cup.  This makes almond flour very desirable for use in cake and bread recipes by people on carbohydrate-restricted diets. \n \n \n In \n \n Greece\n , ground \n blanched almonds are used as the base material in a great variety of desserts, usually called amygdalota (\u03b1\u03bc\u03c5\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03ac).  Because of their white colour, most are traditionally considered \"wedding sweets\" and are served at wedding banquets.\n \n \n \n \n \n Smoked and salted almonds\n \n \n \n Almonds can be processed into a \n milk substitute simply called \n almond milk; the nut's soft texture, mild flavour, and light colouring (when skinned) make for an efficient analog to dairy, and a soy-free choice, for \n lactose intolerant people, \n vegans, and so on. Raw, blanched, and lightly toasted almonds all work well for different production techniques, some of which are very similar to that of \n soymilk and some of which actually use no heat, resulting in \"raw milk\" (see \n raw foodism).\n \n \n Sweet almonds are used in \n marzipan, \n nougat, \n French macaroons, and \n Financiers as well as other desserts. Almonds are a rich source of \n Vitamin E, containing 24 mg per 100 g.15 They are also rich in \n monounsaturated fat, one of the two \"good\" fats responsible for lowering \n LDL cholesterol.\n \n \n The Marcona variety of almond, which is shorter, rounder, sweeter, and more delicate in texture than other varieties, originated in Spain and is becoming popular in North America and other parts of the world.16 Marcona almonds are traditionally served after being lightly fried in oil, and are also used by Spanish chefs to prepare a dessert called \n turr\u00f3n.\n \n \n In \n China, almonds are used in a popular dessert when they are mixed with milk and then served hot. In \n Indian cuisine, almonds are the base ingredient for \n pasanda-style \n curries. Badam Halva is a very tasty sweet made from almond with some added coloring. Also Badam flakes are added to lots of sweets (such as sohan burfy] in India which are usually visible sticking to the outer surface.\n \n \n \n Almond oil\n \n \n \n \"Oleum Amygdalae\", the fixed oil, is prepared from either variety of almond and is a glyceryl oleate, with a slight odour and a nutty taste. It is almost insoluble in \n alcohol but readily soluble in \n chloroform or \n ether. It may be used as a substitute for \n olive oil. \n \n \n The sweet almond oil is obtained from the dried \n kernel of the plant. This oil has been traditionally used by \n massage therapists to lubricate the skin during a massage session, being considered by many to be an effective \n emollient.\n \n \n Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil\n \n \n Pressed from the edible nut kernels, sweet almond oil is an excellent skin-softening oil used for centuries. It is a mild, lightweight oil, rich in unsaturated fats and essential fatty acids which is easily absorbed into the skin. Used to make many natural skin care products,\n it is very high in omega-3.\n \n \n \n \n Almond syrup\n \n \n Historically, almond syrup was an \n emulsion of sweet and bitter almonds usually made with \n barley syrup (\n orgeat syrup) or in a syrup of orange-flower water and \n sugar.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Grocer's Encyclopedia\n \n \n \n \n \n  (1911) notes that \"Ten parts of sweet almonds are generally employed to three parts of bitter almonds\"; however, due to the \n cyanide found in bitter almonds, modern syrups generally consist of only sweet almonds.\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n Possible health benefits\n \n \n Claimed health benefits include improved \n complexion, improved movement of food through the \n \n colon\n  (feces) and the prevention of \n cancer.17 Recent research associates the inclusion of almonds in the diet with elevating the blood levels of \n high density lipoproteins and of lowering the levels of \n low density lipoproteins.1819\n \n \n A controlled trial showed that 73g of almonds in the daily diet reduced LDL cholesterol by as much as 9.4%, reduced the LDL:HDL ratio by 12.0%, and increased HDL-cholesterol (i.e., the good cholesterol) by 4.6%.20\n \n \n In \n \n \n \n \n \n Ayurveda\n \n \n \n \n , an ancient system of health care that is native to the \n Indian subcontinent, almond is considered a nutritive for brain and nervous system.  It is said to induce high intellectual level and longevity.  Almond oil is called Roghan Badam in both Ayurveda and Unani Tibb (the Greco-Persian System of Medicine).  It is extracted by cold process and is considered a nutritive aphrodisiac both for massage and internal consumption. Recent studies have shown that the constituents of almond have anti-inflammatory, immunity boosting, and anti-hepatotoxicity effects.21\n \n \n Because of cases of \n Salmonella traced to almonds in 2001 and 2004, in 2006 the Almond Board of California proposed rules regarding pasteurization of almonds available to the public, and the \n USDA approved them.22 Since 1 September 2007, raw almonds have technically not been available in the United States. Controversially, almonds labeled as \"raw\" are required to be steam pasteurised or chemically treated with \n propylene oxide. This does not apply to imported almonds.23\n \n \n \n \n Cultural aspects\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Almond flowers\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Almond tree in \n \n \n \n Spain\n \n \n .\n \n \n \n The almond is highly revered in some cultures. \n \n \n The tree grows in \n \n Syria\n , \n \n Israel\n  and the \n Palestinian Territories, and is mentioned numerous times in the Bible. The Hebrew name, \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05e7\u05b5\u05d3 \"shaked\", means industrious or vigilant, which is appropriate, as the almond is one of the first trees to flower in Israel, usually in early February, coinciding with Tu Bishvat, the Jewish arbor day. \n \n \n In ancient Israel, the almond was a symbol of watchfulness and promise due to its early flowering, symbolizing God's sudden and rapid punishment of His people; in \n \n \n \n \n \n Jeremiah\n \n \n \n \n  1:11-12, for instance.  In the \n Bible the almond is mentioned ten times, beginning with \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Book of Genesis\n \n \n \n \n \n  43:11, where it is described as \"among the best of fruits\". In \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Numbers\n \n \n \n \n \n  17 \n \n \n \n \n \n Levi\n \n \n \n \n  is chosen from the other tribes of Israel by \n \n \n Aaron's rod\n \n , which brought forth almond flowers. According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore sweet almonds on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the sweet almonds would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate. The almond blossom supplied a model for the \n \n \n menorah\n \n  which stood in the \n Holy Temple, \"Three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers\"  (\n Exodus 25:33-34; 37:19-20). Similarly, Christian symbolism often uses almond branches as a symbol of the \n Virgin Birth of Jesus; paintings often include almonds encircling the \n baby Jesus and as a symbol of \n Mary.  \n \n \n The word \"\n \n \n \n \n \n Luz\n \n \n \n \n \", which appears in \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Genesis\n \n \n \n \n \n  30:37, is usually translated as \"\n hazel\", but some believe it is another name for the almond (Luz in Arabic means Almonds). In India, consumption of almonds is believed to be good for the brain, while the \n Chinese consider it a symbol of enduring sadness and female beauty.\n \n \n \n \n Etymology\n \n \n \n The word \"almond\" comes from Old French almande or alemande, late Latin amandola, derived through a form amingdola from the Greek \u03b1\u03bc\u03c5\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b7 (cf \n Amygdala), an almond. The al- for a- may be due to a confusion with the Arabic article al, the word having first dropped the a- as in the Italian form mandorla; the British pronunciation ah-mond and the modern Catalan ametlla and modern French amande show a form of the word closer to the original.\n \n \n The adjective \"amygdaloid\" (literally \"like an almond\") is often used for things which are roughly almond-shaped, particularly a shape which is partway between a \n rectangle and an \n ellipse.\n \n \n \n \n See also\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Almond milk\n \n , a milky drink made from ground almonds, similar to soy milk\n \n \n  \n Almond Biscuit\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Almond Joy\n \n \n \n , a \n candy bar\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n Blanching\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Fruit trees\n \n \n  \n Fruit tree forms\n \n \n  \n Fruit tree propagation\n \n \n  \n List of edible seeds\n \n \n  \n Marzipan\n \n \n  \n Nougat\n \n \n  \n Pruning fruit trees\n \n \n  \n Turr\u00f3n, a nougat-like Spanish dessert made from almonds\n \n \n \n \n \n \n References\n \n \n \n \n \n Katzer, Gernot (2005-09-11). \"\n Almond (Prunus dulcis)\".

For the other uses, see \n AI (disambiguation).\n Artificial intelligence (AI) is the \n intelligence of \n machines and the branch of \n computer science which aims to create it.\n \n Major AI textbooks define the field as \"the study and design of \n intelligent agents,\"1\n where an \n intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success.2\n \n \n \n John McCarthy\n \n , who coined the term in 1956,3\n defines it as \"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.\"4\n \n \n Among the traits that researchers hope machines will exhibit are \n reasoning, \n knowledge, \n planning, \n learning, \n communication, \n perception and the ability to \n move and manipulate objects.5\n \n General intelligence (or \"\n strong AI\") has not yet been achieved and is a long-term goal of some AI research.6\n \n \n AI research uses tools and insights from many fields, including \n computer science, \n psychology, \n philosophy, \n neuroscience, \n cognitive science, \n linguistics, \n ontology, \n operations research, \n economics, \n control theory, \n probability, \n optimization and \n logic.7\n AI research also overlaps with tasks such as \n robotics, \n control systems, \n scheduling, \n data mining, \n logistics, \n speech recognition, \n facial recognition and many others.8\n \n \n Other names for the field have been proposed, such as \n computational intelligence,9\n \n synthetic intelligence,9\n \n intelligent systems,10\n or computational rationality.11\n These alternative names are sometimes used to set oneself apart from the part of AI dealing with symbols (considered outdated by many, see \n GOFAI) which is often associated with the term \"AI\" itself.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n Artificial intelligence portal\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Perspectives on AI \n \n \n \n  AI in myth, fiction and speculation \n \n \n \n \n \n Main articles: \n artificial intelligence in fiction, \n ethics of artificial intelligence, \n transhumanism, and \n \n \n \n \n \n Technological singularity\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Thinking machines and artificial beings appear in \n Greek myths, such as \n \n Talos\n  of \n \n \n Crete\n \n , the golden robots of \n \n Hephaestus\n  and \n Pygmalion's \n Galatea.12\n Human likenesses believed to have intelligence were built in every civilization, beginning with the \n sacred statues worshipped in \n \n Egypt\n  and \n \n Greece\n ,1314 \n and including the machines of \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Yan Shi\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ,15\n \n \n Hero of Alexandria\n ,16\n \n Al-Jazari17\n or \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Wolfgang von Kempelen\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n .18\n It was widely believed that artificial beings had been created by \n \n Geber\n ,19\n \n Judah Loew20\n and \n \n \n \n \n Paracelsus\n \n \n \n .21 Stories of these creatures and their fates discuss many of the same hopes, fears and \n ethical concerns that are presented by artificial intelligence.22\n \n \n \n \n \n Mary Shelley\n 's \n \n \n \n \n \n Frankenstein\n \n \n \n \n ,23 considers a key issue in the \n ethics of artificial intelligence: if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also feel?  If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human being? The idea also appears in modern \n science fiction: the film  considers a machine in the form of a small boy which has been given the ability to feel human emotions, including, tragically, the capacity to suffer. This issue, now known as \"\n robot rights\", is currently being considered by, for example, California's \n \n \n \n Institute for the Future\n \n \n ,24\n although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.25\n \n \n \n Another issue explored by both \n science fiction writers and \n futurists is the impact of artificial intelligence on society. In fiction, AI has appeared as a servant (\n R2D2 in \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Star Wars\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ), a comrade (\n \n \n \n Lt. Commander Data\n \n \n  in \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Star Trek\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ), an extension to human abilities (\n Ghost in the Shell), a conqueror (\n \n The Matrix\n ), a dictator (\n \n \n With Folded Hands\n \n ), an exterminator (\n Terminator, \n Battlestar Galactica) and a race (\n Asurans in \"\n \n Stargate Atlantis\n \"). Academic sources have considered such consequences as: a decreased demand for human labor;26\n the enhancement of human ability or experience;27\n and a need for redefinition of human identity and basic values.28\n \n \n \n Several \n futurists argue that artificial intelligence will transcend the limits of progress and fundamentally transform humanity. \n Ray Kurzweil has used \n Moore's law (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology with uncanny accuracy) to calculate that \n desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029, and that by 2045 artificial intelligence will reach a point where it is able to improve itself at a rate that far exceeds anything conceivable in the past, a scenario that \n science fiction writer \n \n \n Vernor Vinge\n \n  named the \"\n technological singularity\".27\n \n \n Edward Fredkin\n  argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution,\"29 an idea first proposed by \n \n \n Samuel Butler\n \n 's \n Darwin Among the Machines (1863), and expanded upon by \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n George Dyson\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  in his book of the same name in 1998. \n Several \n futurists and \n science fiction writers have predicted that human beings and machines will merge in the future into \n cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called \n transhumanism, which has roots in \n \n \n Aldous Huxley\n \n  and \n Robert Ettinger, is now associated with robot designer \n Hans Moravec, cyberneticist \n \n \n Kevin Warwick\n \n  and inventor \n Ray Kurzweil.27 \n Transhumanism has been illustrated in fiction as well, for example on the \n manga \n Ghost in the Shell. Pamela McCorduck believes that these scenarios are expressions of an ancient human desire to, as she calls it, \"forge the gods.\"22\n \n \n \n \n  History of AI research \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Main articles: \n history of artificial intelligence and \n timeline of artificial intelligence\n \n \n In the middle of the 20th century, a handful of scientists began a new approach to building intelligent machines, based on recent discoveries in \n neurology, a new mathematical theory of \n information, an understanding of control and stability called \n cybernetics, and above all, by the invention of the \n digital computer, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning.30\n \n \n The field of modern AI research was founded at a conference on the campus of \n \n Dartmouth College\n  in the summer of 1956.31\n Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for many decades, especially \n \n \n John McCarthy\n \n , \n \n \n Marvin Minsky\n \n , \n \n \n Allen Newell\n \n  and \n \n \n Herbert Simon\n \n , who founded AI laboratories at \n MIT, \n \n CMU\n  and \n Stanford. They and their students wrote programs that were, to most people, simply astonishing:32\n computers were solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.33\n By the middle 60s their research was heavily funded by the \n \n U.S. Department of Defense\n 34\n and they were optimistic about the future of the new field:\n \n \n \n  1965, \n H. A. Simon: \"[M]achines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\"35\n \n \n  1967, \n \n \n Marvin Minsky\n \n : \"Within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved.\"36\n \n \n \n \n These predictions, and many like them, would not come true. They had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the problems they faced.37\n In 1974, in response to the criticism of England's \n Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from Congress to fund more productive projects, the U.S. and British governments cut off all undirected, exploratory research in AI. This was the first \n AI Winter.38\n \n \n In the early 80s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of \n expert systems39\n (a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of one or more human experts). By 1985 the market for AI had reached more than a billion dollars and governments around the world poured money back into the field.40\n However, just a few years later, beginning with the collapse of the \n Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, more lasting \n AI Winter began.41\n \n \n In the 90s and early 21st century AI achieved its greatest successes, albeit somewhat behind the scenes. Artificial intelligence was adopted throughout the technology industry, providing the heavy lifting for \n logistics, \n data mining, \n medical diagnosis and many other areas.42\n The success was due to several factors: the incredible power of computers today (see \n Moore's law), a greater emphasis on solving specific subproblems, the creation of new ties between AI and other fields working on similar problems, and above all a new commitment by researchers to solid mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standards.43\n \n \n \n \n  Philosophy of AI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n Mind and Brain portal\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n philosophy of artificial intelligence\n \n \n Artificial intelligence, by claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human \n mind, is both a challenge and an inspiration for \n philosophy. Are there limits to how intelligent machines can be? Is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence? Can a machine have a \n mind and \n consciousness? A few of the most influential answers to these questions are given below.44\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Turing's \"polite convention\": If a machine acts as intelligently as a human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being. \n \n \n Alan Turing\n \n  theorized that, ultimately, we can only judge the intelligence of machine based on its behavior. This theory forms the basis of the \n Turing test.45\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  The \n Dartmouth proposal: \"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.\" This assertion was printed in the proposal for the \n Dartmouth Conference of 1956, and represents the position of most working AI researchers.46\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n Newell and Simon's physical symbol system hypothesis\n \n \n : \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\" This statement claims that the essence of intelligence is symbol manipulation.47 \n \n Hubert Dreyfus\n  argued that, on the contrary, human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a \"feel\" for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.4849\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem: A \n formal system (such as a computer program) can not prove all true statements. \n \n \n Roger Penrose\n \n  is among those who claim that G\u00f6del's theorem limits what machines can do.5051\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Searle's strong AI hypothesis\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n : \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"52 Searle counters this assertion with his \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Chinese room\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  argument, which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the \"mind\" might be.53\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  The \n artificial brain argument: The brain can be simulated. \n Hans Moravec, \n Ray Kurzweil and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software, and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original. This argument combines the idea that a \n suitably powerful machine can simulate any process, with the \n materialist idea that the \n mind is the result of physical processes in the \n brain.54\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  AI research \n \n \n \n  Problems of AI \n \n \n \n While there is no universally accepted definition of intelligence,55\n AI researchers have studied several traits that are considered essential.5\n \n \n \n Deduction, reasoning, problem solving \n \n \n Early AI researchers developed algorithms that imitated the process of conscious, step-by-step reasoning that human beings use when they solve puzzles, play board games, or make logical deductions.56\n By the late 80s and 90s, AI research had also developed highly successful methods for dealing with \n uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from \n probability and \n economics.57\n \n \n For difficult problems, most of these algorithms can require enormous computational resources \u2014 most experience a \"\n combinatorial explosion\": the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond a certain size. The search for more efficient problem solving algorithms is a high priority for AI research.58\n \n \n It is not clear, however, that conscious human reasoning is any more efficient when faced with a difficult abstract problem. \n Cognitive scientists have demonstrated that human beings solve most of their problems using nonconscious reasoning, rather than the conscious, step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model.59\n \n Embodied cognitive science argues that \n sensorimotor skills are essential to our problem solving abilities. It is hoped that sub-symbolic methods, like \n computational intelligence and \n situated AI, will be able to model these instinctive skills. The problem of unconscious problem solving, which forms part of our \n commonsense reasoning, is largely unsolved      .\n \n \n \n \n Knowledge representation\n \n \n \n \n \n Main articles: \n knowledge representation and \n commonsense knowledge\n \n \n \n Knowledge representation60\n and \n knowledge engineering61\n are central to AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;62\n situations, events, states and time;63\n causes and effects;64\n knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);65\n and many other, less well researched domains. A complete representation of \"what exists\" is an \n ontology66\n (borrowing a word from traditional \n philosophy), of which the most general are called \n upper ontologies.\n \n \n Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:\n \n \n \n \n \n  Default reasoning and the \n qualification problem: Many of the things people know take the form of \"working assumptions.\" For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about birds in general. \n \n \n John McCarthy\n \n  identified this problem in 196967 as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.68\n \n \n  Unconscious knowledge: Much of what people know isn't represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could actually say out loud. They take the form of intuitions or tendencies and are represented in the brain unconsciously and sub-symbolically. This unconscious knowledge informs, supports and provides a context for our conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of unconscious reasoning, it is hoped that \n situated AI or \n computational intelligence will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.\n \n \n  The breadth of \n common sense knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is astronomical. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of \n commonsense knowledge, such as \n Cyc, require enormous amounts of tedious step-by-step ontological engineering \u2014 they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.69\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Planning\n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n automated planning and scheduling\n \n \n Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.70\n They need a way to visualize the future (they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it) and be able to make choices that maximize the \n utility (or \"value\") of the available choices.\n \n \n In some planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be.71\n However, if this is not true, it must periodically check if the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary, requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty.72\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Multi-agent planning\n \n \n  uses the \n cooperation and \n competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. \n Emergent behavior such as this is used by \n evolutionary algorithms and \n swarm intelligence.73\n \n \n \n \n Learning\n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n machine learning\n \n \n Important \n machine learning74\n problems are:\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Unsupervised learning: find a model that matches a stream of input \"experiences\", and be able to predict what new \"experiences\" to expect.\n \n \n  \n Supervised learning, such as \n classification (be able to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from each category), or \n regression (given a set of numerical input/output examples, discover a continuous function that would generate the outputs from the inputs).\n \n \n  \n Reinforcement learning:75 the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. (These can be analyzed in terms \n decision theory, using concepts like \n utility).\n \n \n \n \n The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of \n theoretical computer science known as \n computational learning theory.\n \n \n \n \n Natural language processing\n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n natural language processing\n \n \n \n Natural language processing76\n gives machines the ability to read and understand the languages human beings speak. Many researchers hope that a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would be able to acquire knowledge on its own, by reading the existing text available over the internet. Some straigh shy;tforward applications of natural language processing include \n information retrieval (or \n text mining) and \n machine translation.77\n \n \n \n \n Motion and manipulation\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n robotics\n \n \n The field of \n robotics78\n is closely related to AI. Intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation79\n and \n navigation, with sub-problems of \n localization (knowing where you are), \n mapping (learning what is around you) and \n motion planning (figuring out how to get there).80\n \n \n \n \n Perception\n \n \n \n \n \n Main articles: \n machine perception, \n computer vision, and \n speech recognition\n \n \n \n Machine perception81\n is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, sonar and others more exotic) to deduce aspects of the world. \n Computer vision82\n is the ability to analyze visual input. A few selected subproblems are \n speech recognition,83\n \n facial recognition and \n object recognition.84\n \n \n \n \n Social intelligence\n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n affective computing\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Emotion and social skills play two roles for an intelligent agent:85\n \n \n \n  It must be able to predict the actions of others, by understanding their motives and emotional states. (This involves elements of \n game theory, \n decision theory, as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions.)\n \n \n  For good \n human-computer interaction, an intelligent machine also needs to display emotions \u2014 at the very least it must appear polite and sensitive to the humans it interacts with. At best, it should appear to have normal emotions itself.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Creativity\n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n computational creativity\n \n \n A sub-field of AI addresses \n creativity both theoretically (from a philosophical and psychological perspective) and practically (via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative).\n \n \n \n \n General intelligence\n \n \n \n \n \n Main articles: \n strong AI and \n AI-complete\n \n \n Most researchers hope that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with general intelligence (known as \n strong AI), combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them.6 A few believe that \n anthropomorphic features like \n artificial consciousness or an \n artificial brain may be required for such a project.\n \n \n Many of the problems above are considered \n AI-complete: to solve one problem, you must solve them all. For example, even a straigh shy;tforward, specific task like \n machine translation requires that the machine follow the author's argument (\n reason), know what it's talking about (\n knowledge), and faithfully reproduce the author's intention (\n social intelligence). \n Machine translation, therefore, is believed to be AI-complete: it may require \n strong AI to be done as well as humans can do it.86\n \n \n \n \n \n  Approaches to AI \n \n \n \n Artificial intelligence is a young science and there is still no established unifying theory. The field is fragmented87 and research communities have grown around different approaches.\n \n \n \n  Cybernetics and brain simulation \n \n \n \n \n \n The \n human brain provides inspiration for artificial intelligence researchers, however there is no consensus on how closely it should be \n simulated.\n \n \n \n In the 40s and 50s, a number of researchers explored the connection between \n neurology, \n information theory, and \n cybernetics. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as \n W. Grey Walter's \n \n \n \n \n \n turtles\n \n \n \n \n  and the \n Johns Hopkins Beast. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the \n Teleological Society at Princeton and the \n \n \n Ratio Club\n \n  in England.30\n \n \n \n \n  Traditional symbolic AI \n \n \n When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: \n \n CMU\n , \n Stanford and \n MIT, and each one developed its own style of research. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n John Haugeland\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  named these approaches to AI \"good old fashioned AI\" or \"\n GOFAI\".88\n \n \n \n \n \n  Cognitive simulation:\n Economist \n \n \n Herbert Simon\n \n  and \n Alan Newell studied human problem solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as \n cognitive science, \n operations research and \n management science. Their research team performed \n psychological experiments to demonstrate the similarities between human problem solving and the programs (such as their \"\n General Problem Solver\") they were developing. This tradition, centered at \n \n Carnegie Mellon University\n  would eventually culminate in the development of the \n Soar architecture in the middle 80s.8990\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Logical AI: Unlike \n Newell and \n \n \n Simon\n \n , \n \n \n John McCarthy\n \n  felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.91 His laboratory at \n \n Stanford\n  (\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n SAIL\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ) focused on using formal \n logic to solve a wide variety of problems, including \n knowledge representation, \n planning and \n learning.92 Logic was also focus of the work at the \n \n University of Edinburgh\n  and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language \n Prolog and the science of \n logic programming.93\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \"Scruffy\" symbolic AI: Researchers at \n MIT (such as \n \n \n Marvin Minsky\n \n  and \n \n \n Seymour Papert\n \n ) found that solving difficult problems in \n vision and \n natural language processing required ad-hoc solutions   they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like \n logic) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. \n \n \n \n \n \n Roger Schank\n \n \n \n \n  described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as \"\n scruffy\" (as opposed to the \"\n neat\" paradigms at \n CMU and \n Stanford),9495 and this still forms the basis of research into \n commonsense knowledge bases (such as \n Doug Lenat's \n Cyc) which must be built one complicated concept at a time.96\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Knowledge based AI: When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build \n knowledge into AI applications.97 This \"knowledge revolution\" led to the development and deployment of \n expert systems (introduced by \n \n \n Edward Feigenbaum\n \n ), the first truly successful form of AI software.39 The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that truly enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Sub-symbolic AI \n \n \n \n During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on \n cybernetics or \n neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background.98\n By the 1980s, however, progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially \n perception, \n robotics, \n learning and \n pattern recognition. A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific AI problems.99\n \n \n \n \n \n  Bottom-up, situated, behavior based or nouvelle AI: Researchers from the related field of \n robotics, such as \n \n \n Rodney Brooks\n \n , rejected symbolic AI and focussed on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.100 Their work revived the non-symbolic viewpoint of the early \n cybernetics researchers of the 50s and reintroduced the use of \n control theory in AI. These approaches are also conceptually related to the \n embodied mind thesis.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Computational Intelligence:Interest in \n neural networks and \"\n connectionism\" was revived by \n David Rumelhart and others in the middle 1980s.101 These and other sub-symbolic approaches, such as \n fuzzy systems and \n evolutionary computation, are now studied collectively by the emerging discipline of \n computational intelligence.102\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Formalisation: In the 1990s, AI researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems. These tools are truly \n scientific, in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable, and they have been responsible for many of AI's recent successes. The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like \n mathematics, \n economics or \n operations research). \n Russell   Norvig (2003) describe this movement as nothing less than a \"revolution\" and \"the victory of the \n neats.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Intelligent agent paradigm \n \n \n \n The \"\n intelligent agent\" \n paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.103\n An \n intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximizes its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. The most complicated intelligent agents are rational, thinking human beings.104\n The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful, without agreeing on one single approach. An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works \u2014 some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic \n neural networks and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields\u2014such as \n decision theory and \n economics\u2014that also use concepts of abstract agents.\n \n \n \n \n  Integrating the approaches \n \n \n \n An \n agent architecture or \n cognitive architecture allows researchers to build more versatile and intelligent systems out of interacting \n intelligent agents in a \n multi-agent system.105\n A system with both symbolic and sub-symbolic components is a \n hybrid intelligent system, and the study of such systems is \n artificial intelligence systems integration. A \n hierarchical control system provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling.106\n \n \n \n Rodney Brooks\n \n ' \n subsumption architecture was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Tools of AI research \n \n \n \n In the course of 50 years of research, AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in \n computer science. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.\n \n \n \n  Search and optimization \n \n \n \n \n \n Main articles: \n search algorithm, \n optimization (mathematics), and \n evolutionary computation\n \n \n Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:107 \n \n Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from \n premises to \n conclusions, where each step is the application of an \n inference rule.108\n \n Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called \n means-ends analysis.109\n \n Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use \n local searches in \n configuration space.79 \n Many \n learning algorithms use search algorithms based on \n optimization.\n \n \n Simple exhaustive searches110\n are rarely sufficient for most real world problems: the \n search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to \n astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is \n too slow or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use \"\n heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal (called \"\n pruning the \n search tree\"). \n Heuristics supply the program with a \"best guess\" for what path the solution lies on.111\n \n \n A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of \n optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind \n hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are \n simulated annealing, \n beam search and \n random optimization.112 \n \n \n \n Evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, \n selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Forms of \n evolutionary computation include \n swarm intelligence algorithms (such as \n ant colony or \n particle swarm optimization)113\n and \n evolutionary algorithms (such as \n genetic algorithms114 \n and \n genetic programming115116).\n \n \n \n \n  Logic \n \n \n \n \n \n Main articles: \n logic programming and \n automated reasoning\n \n \n \n Logic117\n was introduced into AI research by \n \n \n John McCarthy\n \n  in his 1958 \n Advice Taker proposal. The most important technical development was \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n J. Alan Robinson\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 's discovery of the \n resolution and \n unification algorithm for logical deduction in 1963. This procedure is simple, complete and entirely algorithmic, and can easily be performed by digital computers.118\n However, a naive implementation of the algorithm quickly leads to a \n combinatorial explosion or an \n infinite loop. In 1974, \n \n \n Robert Kowalski\n \n  suggested representing logical expressions as \n Horn clauses (statements in the form of rules: \"if p then q\"), which reduced logical deduction to \n backward chaining or \n forward chaining. This greatly alleviated (but did not eliminate) the problem.108119\n \n \n Logic is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the \n satplan algorithm uses logic for \n planning,120\n and \n inductive logic programming is a method for \n learning.121\n There are several different forms of logic used in AI research.\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Propositional or \n sentential logic122 is the logic of statements which can be true or false.\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n First-order logic\n \n \n 123 also allows the use of \n quantifiers and \n predicates, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other.\n \n \n  \n Fuzzy logic, a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0). \n Fuzzy systems can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems.124\n \n \n  \n Default logics, \n non-monotonic logics and \n circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the \n qualification problem.68\n \n \n  Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of \n knowledge, such as: \n description logics;62 \n situation calculus, \n event calculus and \n fluent calculus (for representing events and time);63 \n causal calculus;64 \n belief calculus; and \n modal logics.65\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\n \n \n \n \n \n Main articles: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bayesian network\n \n \n \n \n \n , \n hidden Markov model, \n \n \n \n \n Kalman filter\n \n \n \n , \n decision theory, and \n utility theory\n \n \n Many problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. Starting in the late 80s and early 90s, \n \n \n Judea Pearl\n \n  and others championed the use of methods drawn from \n probability theory and \n economics to devise a number of powerful tools to solve these problems.125126\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bayesian network\n \n \n \n \n \n s127\n are very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the \n Bayesian inference algorithm),128\n \n learning (using the \n expectation-maximization algorithm),129\n \n planning (using \n decision networks)130\n and \n perception (using \n dynamic Bayesian networks).131\n \n \n Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping \n perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time132\n (e.g., \n hidden Markov models133\n and \n \n \n \n \n Kalman filter\n \n \n \n s134).\n \n \n A key concept from the science of \n economics is \"\n utility\": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using \n decision theory, \n decision analysis,135\n \n information value theory.136\n These tools include models such as \n Markov decision processes,137\n dynamic \n decision networks,137\n \n game theory and \n mechanism design138\n \n \n \n \n  Classifiers and statistical learning methods \n \n \n \n \n \n Main articles: \n classifier (mathematics), \n statistical classification, and \n machine learning\n \n \n The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\"if shiny then diamond\") and controllers (\"if shiny then pick up\"). Controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems.\n \n \n \n Classifiers139\n are functions that use \n pattern matching  to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set.\n \n \n When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. A classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and \n machine learning approaches.\n \n \n A wide range of classifiers are available, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified. There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems; this is also referred to as the \"no free lunch\" theorem. Various empirical tests have been performed to compare classifier performance and to find the characteristics of data that determine classifier performance. Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is however still more an art than science.\n \n \n The most widely used classifiers are the \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n neural network\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ,\n \n kernel methods such as the \n support vector machine,140\n \n k-nearest neighbor algorithm,141\n \n Gaussian mixture model,142\n \n naive Bayes classifier,143\n and \n decision tree.144\n The performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of classification tasks145\n in order to find data characteristics that determine classifier performance.\n \n \n \n \n  Neural networks \n \n \n \n \n \n Main articles: \n neural networks and \n connectionism\n \n \n \n \n A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of \n neurons in the \n human brain.\n \n \n \n \n \n The study of \n artificial neural networks146\n began in the decade before the field AI research was founded. In the 1960s \n \n \n \n \n \n Frank Rosenblatt\n \n \n \n \n  developed an important early version, the \n perceptron.147\n \n \n \n \n \n Paul Werbos\n \n \n \n  developed the \n backpropagation algorithm for \n multilayer perceptrons in 1974,148\n which led to a renaissance in neural network research and \n connectionism in general in the middle 1980s. The \n Hopfield net, a form of \n attractor network, was first described by \n John Hopfield in 1982.  \n \n \n Common network architectures which have been developed include the \n feedforward neural network, the \n radial basis network, the Kohonen \n self-organizing map and various \n recurrent neural networks. Neural networks are applied to the problem of \n learning, using such techniques as \n Hebbian learning, \n competitive learning149\n and the relatively new field of \n Hierarchical Temporal Memory which simulates the architecture of the \n neocortex.150\n \n \n \n \n  Control theory \n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n intelligent control\n \n \n \n Control theory, the grandchild of \n cybernetics, has many important applications, especially in \n robotics.151\n \n \n \n \n  Specialized languages \n \n \n \n AI researchers have developed several specialized languages for AI research:\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n IPL,152 includes features intended to support programs that could perform general problem solving, including lists, associations, schemas (frames), dynamic memory allocation, data types, recursion, associative retrieval, functions as arguments, generators (streams), and cooperative multitasking.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Lisp153154 is a practical mathematical notation for computer programs based on \n lambda calculus. \n Linked lists are one of Lisp languages' major \n data structures, and Lisp \n source code is itself made up of lists. As a result, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the \n \n \n macro\n \n  systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or even new \n domain-specific programming languages embedded in Lisp. There are many dialects of Lisp in use today.\n \n \n  \n Prolog,155119 is a \n declarative language where programs are expressed in terms of relations, and execution occurs by running queries over these relations. Prolog is particularly useful for symbolic reasoning, database and language parsing applications. Prolog is widely used in AI today.\n \n \n  \n STRIPS, a language for expressing \n automated planning problem instances. It expresses an initial state, the goal states, and a set of actions. For each action preconditions (what must be established before the action is performed) and postconditions (what is established after the action is performed) are specified.\n \n \n  \n \n Planner\n  is a hybrid between procedural and logical languages. It gives a procedural interpretation to logical sentences where implications are interpreted with pattern-directed inference.\n \n \n AI applications are also often written in standard languages like \n \n C++\n  and languages designed for mathematics, such as \n Matlab and \n \n Lush\n .\n \n \n \n \n \n  Evaluating artificial intelligence \n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n Progress in artificial intelligence\n \n How can one determine if an agent is intelligent? In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the \n Turing test. This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested. However, it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail.\n \n \n Artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry, hand-writing recognition and game-playing. Such tests have been termed \n subject matter expert Turing tests. Smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.\n \n \n The broad classes of outcome for an AI test are:\n \n \n \n \n \n  optimal: it is not possible to perform better\n \n \n  strong super-human: performs better than all humans\n \n \n  super-human: performs better than most humans\n \n \n  sub-human: performs worse than most humans\n \n \n \n \n For example, performance at checkers (\n draughts) is optimal,156\n performance at chess is super-human and nearing strong super-human,157\n and performance at many everyday tasks performed by humans is sub-human.\n \n \n \n \n  Competitions and prizes \n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n Competitions and prizes in artificial intelligence\n \n There are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence. The main areas promoted are: general machine intelligence, conversational behaviour, data-mining, driverless cars, robot soccer and games.\n \n \n \n \n \n  Applications of artificial intelligence \n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n Applications of artificial intelligence\n \n \n Artificial intelligence has successfully been used in a wide range of fields including \n medical diagnosis, \n stock trading, \n robot control, \n law, scientific discovery and toys. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use it is no longer considered artificial intelligence, sometimes described as the \n AI effect.158\n It may also become integrated into \n artificial life.\n \n \n \n \n  See also \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n List of basic artificial intelligence topics\n \n \n  \n Artificial intelligence researchers|List of AI researchers\n \n \n  \n List of AI projects\n \n \n  \n List of important AI publications\n \n \n  \n List of emerging technologies\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Notes \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Poole, Mackworth   Goebel 1998, \n p. 1 (who use the term \"computational intelligence\" as a synonym for artificial intelligence).

called the \"psychological assumption\": \"The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules\".  (\n Dreyfus 1992, p. 156)\n \n \"We cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent.\" \n \n \n John McCarthy\n \n , \n Basic Questions\n \n \n Artificial brain:\n \n \n \n  \n Moravec 1988\n \n \n  \n Kurzweil 2005, p. 262\n \n \n  \n Russell Norvig, p. 957 \n \n \n  \n Crevier 1993, pp. 271 and 279\n \n \n The most extreme form of this argument (the brain replacement scenario) was put forward by \n Clark Glymour in the mid-70s and was touched on by \n \n Zenon Pylyshyn\n  and \n \n John Searle\n  in 1980. Daniel Dennett sees human consciousness as multiple functional thought patterns; see \"Consciousness Explained.\"\n \n \n Searle's \n Chinese Room argument:\n \n \n \n  \n Searle 1980, \n Searle 1991\n \n \n  \n Russell   Norvig 2003, pp. 958-960\n \n \n  \n McCorduck 2004, pp. 443-445\n \n \n  \n Crevier 1993, pp. 269-271\n \n \n \n This version is from \n Searle (1999), and is also quoted in \n Dennett 1991, p. 435. Searle's original formulation was \"The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states.\"   (\n Searle 1980, p. 1). Strong AI is defined similarly by \n Russell   Norvig (2003, p. 947): \"The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis.\"\n \n Several famous examples: \n \n \n \n  \n Wason (1966) showed that people do poorly on completely abstract problems, but if the problem is restated to allowed the use of intuitive \n social intelligence, performance dramatically improves. (See \n \n \n \n \n \n Wason selection task\n \n \n \n \n )\n \n \n  \n Tversky, Slovic   Kahnemann (1982) have shown that people are terrible at elementary problems that involve uncertain reasoning. (See \n list of cognitive biases for several examples).\n \n \n  \n Lakoff   N\u00fa\u00f1ez (2000) have controversially argued that even our skills at mathematics depend on knowledge and skills that come from \"the body\", i.e. sensorimotor and perceptual skills.

If the list is a \n statistical population, then the mean of that population is called a population mean. If the list is a \n statistical sample, we call the resulting \n statistic a sample mean.\n \n The mean is the most commonly-used type of \n average and is often referred to simply as the average. The term \"mean\" or \"arithmetic mean\" is preferred in mathematics and statistics to distinguish it from other \n averages such as the \n median and the \n mode.\n \n \n \n Introduction\n \n \n If we denote a set of data by X = (x1, x2, ..., xn), then the sample mean is typically denoted with a horizontal bar over the variable (\\bar{x} \\,, enunciated \"x bar\").\n \n \n The \n Greek letter \u03bc is used to denote the arithmetic mean of an entire population.  Or, for a \n random variable that has a defined mean, \u03bc is the probabilistic mean or \n expected value of the random number.  If the set X is a collection of random numbers with probabilistic mean of \u03bc, then for any individual sample, xi, from that collection, \u03bc = E{xi} is the \n expected value of that sample.\n \n \n In practice, the difference between \u03bc and \\bar{x} \\, is that \u03bc is typically unobservable because one observes only a sample rather than the whole population, and if the sample is drawn randomly, then one may treat \\bar{x} \\,, but not \u03bc, as a \n random variable, attributing a \n probability distribution to it (the \n sampling distribution of the mean).\n \n \n Both are computed in the same way:\n \n \n \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i  =  \\frac{1}{n} (x_1+\\cdots+x_n).\n \n \n If X is a \n random variable, then the \n expected value of X can be seen as the long-term arithmetic mean that occurs on repeated measurements of X. This is the content of the \n law of large numbers. As a result, the sample mean is used to estimate unknown expected values.\n \n \n Simple algebra will prove that a mean of n + 1 numbers is larger than the mean of n numbers if and only if the new number is larger than the old mean, smaller if and only if it is smaller, and remains stable if and only if it is equal to the old mean.  The larger n is, the smaller is the magnitude of the change in the mean relative to the distance between the old mean and the new number.\n \n \n Note that several other \"means\" have been defined, including the \n generalized mean, the \n generalized f-mean, the \n harmonic mean, the \n arithmetic-geometric mean, and various \n weighted means.\n \n \n \n Examples\n \n \n \n \n \n  For three numbers, add them and divide them by 3:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}.\n \n \n \n \n \n  For four numbers, add them and divide by 4:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4}{4}.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Problems with some uses of the mean\n \n \n \n Not robust\n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n Robust statistics\n \n While the mean is often used to report \n central tendency, it is not a \n robust statistic, meaning that it is greatly influenced by \n outliers. Notably, for \n skewed distributions, the arithmetic mean may not accord with one's notion of \"middle\", and robust statistics such as the \n median may be a better description of central tendency.\n \n \n A classic example is \n average income. The arithmetic mean may be misinterpreted as the median to imply that most people's incomes are higher than is in fact the case.  When presented with an \"average\" one may be led to believe that most people's incomes are near this number.  This \"average\" (arithmetic mean) income is higher than most people's incomes, because high income outliers skew the result higher (in contrast, the median income \"resists\" such skew). However, this \"average\" says nothing about the number of people near the median income (nor does it say anything about the modal income that most people are near).  Nevertheless, because one might carelessly relate \"average\" and \"most people\" one might incorrectly assume that most people's incomes would be higher (nearer this inflated \"average\") than they are. For instance, reporting the \"average\" \n net worth in \n \n Medina, Washington\n  as the arithmetic mean of all annual net worths would yield a surprisingly high number because of \n \n Bill Gates\n . Consider the scores (1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 9). The arithmetic mean is 3.17, but five out of six scores are below this.\n \n \n \n \n Compounding\n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n Rate of return\n \n \n If numbers multiply instead of add, one should average using the \n geometric mean, not the arithmetic mean. This most often happens when computing the \n rate of return, as in finance.\n \n \n For example, if a stock fell 10 % in the first year, and rose 30 % in the second year, then it would be incorrect to report its \"average\" increase per year over this two year period as the arithmetic mean ( minus;10 % + 30 %)/2 = 10 %; the correct average in this case is the \n compound annual growth rate, which yields an annualized increase per year of only 8.2 %.\n \n \n The reason for this is that each of those percents have different starting points: the 30% is 30% of a smaller number. If the stock starts at $30 and falls 10 %, it is now at $27. If the stock then rises 30 %, it is now $35.1. The arithmetic mean of those rises is 10 %, but since the stock rose by $5.1 in 2 years, an \n average of 8.2 % would result in the final $35.1 figure [$30(1-10 %)(1+30 %) = $30(1+8.2 %)(1+8.2 %) = $35.1]. If one used the arithmetic mean 10 % in the same way, one would not get the actual increase [$30(1+10 %)(1+10 %) = $36.3].\n \n \n Stated generally, compounding yields 90% * 130% = 117% overall growth, and annualizing yields \\sqrt{117%}\\approx 108.2%, so 8.2% per year.\n \n \n \n \n Directions\n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n \n \n \n \n \n Directional statistics\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Particular care must be taken when using cyclic data such as phases or \n angles. Na\u00efvely taking the arithmetic mean of 1\u00b0 and 359\u00b0 yields a result of 180\u00b0.\n This is incorrect for two reasons:\n \n \n \n  Firstly, angle measurements are only defined up to a factor of \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 360\u00b0\n \n \n \n \n \n  (or 2\u03c0, if measuring in \n radians). Thus one could as easily call these 1\u00b0 and -1\u00b0, or 1\u00b0 and 719\u00b0 \u2013 each of which gives a different average.\n \n \n  Secondly, in this situation, 0\u00b0 (equivalently, 360\u00b0) is geometrically a better average value: there is lower \n dispersion about it (the points are both 1\u00b0 from it, and 179\u00b0 from 180\u00b0, the putative average).\n \n \n \n \n In general application such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range.  A solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation (viz, define the mean as the central point: the point about which one has the lowest dispersion), and redefine the difference as a modular distance (i.e., the distance on the circle: so the modular distance between 1\u00b0 and 359\u00b0 is 2\u00b0, not 358\u00b0).\n \n \n \n \n \n See also\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n Statistics portal\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Average\n \n \n  \n Mean\n \n \n  \n Mode\n \n \n  \n Median\n \n \n  \n Summary statistics\n \n \n  \n Central tendency\n \n \n  \n Generalized mean\n \n \n  \n Geometric mean\n \n \n  \n Variance\n \n \n  \n Standard deviation\n \n \n  \n Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means\n \n \n  \n Muirhead's inequality\n \n \n  \n Sample size\n \n \n  \n Sample mean and covariance\n \n \n  \n Empirical measure\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Further reading\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Darrell Huff\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n , How to lie with statistics, Victor Gollancz, 1954 (ISBN 0-393-31072-8).\n \n \n \n \n \n \n External links\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Calculations and comparisons between arithmetic and geometric mean between two numbers\n \n \n \n Mean or Average\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Statistics\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Design of experiments\n \n \n Population  bull;

The study of agriculture is known as \n agricultural science. The related practice of \n gardening is studied in \n horticulture.\n \n Agriculture encompasses a wide variety of specialties. \n Cultivation of \n crops on \n arable land and the \n pastoral \n herding of \n livestock on \n rangeland remain at the foundation of agriculture. In the past century a distinction has been made between \n sustainable agriculture and \n intensive farming. Modern \n agronomy, \n plant breeding, \n pesticides and \n fertilizers, and technological improvements have sharply increased yields from cultivation. \n Selective breeding and modern practices in \n animal husbandry such as \n intensive pig farming (and similar practices applied to the \n chicken) have similarly increased the output of \n meat. The more exotic varieties of agriculture include \n aquaculture and \n tree farming.\n \n \n The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into \n foods, \n fibers, \n fuels, \n raw materials, \n pharmaceuticals and \n illegal drugs, and an assortment of ornamental or otherwise exotic products. In recent years plants have been used to grow \n biofuels, \n biopharmaceuticals, \n bioplastics,1 and pharmaceuticals.2 Specific foods include \n cereals, \n vegetables, \n fruits, and \n meat. \n Fibers include \n cotton, \n wool, \n hemp, \n silk and \n flax. \n Raw materials include lumber and bamboo. Drugs include \n tobacco, \n marijuana, \n opium, \n cocaine, \n digitalis, \n curare, \n eugenol, \n reserpine, \n pyrethrins, \n taxol) and other useful materials such as \n resins.  Biofuels include \n methane from \n biomass, \n ethanol, and \n biodiesel.  \n Cut flowers, \n nursery plants, tropical fish and birds for the pet trade are some of the ornamental products.\n \n \n The \n history of agriculture has played a major role in \n human history, as agricultural progress has been a crucial factor in worldwide \n socio-economic change. \n Wealth-building and \n militaristic specializations rarely seen in \n hunter-gatherer cultures are commonplace in societies which practice agriculture. So, too, are arts such as epic literature and monumental architecture, as well as codified legal systems. When farmers became capable of producing food beyond the needs of their own families, others in their society were freed to devote themselves to projects other than food acquisition. Historians and anthropologists have long argued that the development of agriculture made civilization possible.\n \n \n In 2007, an estimated 35 percent of the world's workers were employed in agriculture (from 42% in 1996). However, the relative significance of farming has dropped steadily since the beginning of \n industrialization, and in 2003 \u2013 for the first time in history \u2013 the \n services sector overtook agriculture as the \n economic sector employing the most people worldwide.3 Despite the fact that agriculture employs over one-third of the world's population, agricultural production accounts for less than five percent of the \n gross world product (an aggregate of all \n gross domestic products).4\n \n \n \n Overview\n \n \n \n \n \n The amount of workforce dedicated to agriculture tends to decrease.\n \n \n  \n Agriculture has played a key role in the development of human \n civilization it is widely believed that the domestication of plants and animals allowed \n humans to settle and give up their previous \n hunter-gatherer lifestyle during the \n \n \n \n \n \n Neolithic Revolution\n \n \n \n \n . Until the \n \n \n \n \n \n Industrial Revolution\n \n \n \n \n , the vast majority of the human population labored in agriculture. Development of agricultural techniques has steadily increased agricultural productivity, and the widespread diffusion of these techniques during a time period is often called an \n agricultural revolution. A remarkable shift in agricultural practices has occurred over the past century in response to new technologies. In particular, the \n Haber-Bosch method for synthesizing \n ammonium nitrate made the traditional practice of recycling nutrients with \n crop rotation and animal \n manure less necessary. Synthetic nitrogen, along with mined \n rock phosphate, \n pesticides and \n mechanization, have greatly increased \n crop yields in the early 20th century. Increased supply of grains has led to cheaper livestock as well. Further, global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when \n high-yield varieties of common staple grains such as \n rice, \n wheat, and corn (\n maize) were introduced as a part of the \n Green Revolution. The Green Revolution exported the technologies (including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen) of the developed world out to the developing world. \n \n \n Thomas Malthus\n \n  famously predicted that the Earth would not be able to support its growing population, but technologies such as the Green Revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food.5\n \n \n \n Agricultural output in 2005.\n \n \n \n \n \n Many governments have subsidized agriculture to ensure an adequate food supply. These \n agricultural subsidies are often linked to the production of certain commodities such as \n wheat, corn (\n maize), \n rice, \n soybeans, and \n milk. These subsidies, especially when done by \n developed countries have been noted as \n protectionist, inefficient, and environmentally damaging.6 In the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced \n productivity, the use of synthetic \n fertilizers and pesticides, \n selective breeding, \n mechanization, \n water contamination, and \n farm subsidies. Proponents of \n organic farming such as \n Sir Albert Howard argued in the early 1900s that the overuse of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers damages the long-term fertility of the soil. While this feeling lay dormant for decades, as \n environmental awareness has increased recently there has been a movement towards \n sustainable agriculture by some farmers, consumers, and policymakers. In recent years there has been a backlash against perceived \n external environmental effects of mainstream agriculture, particularly regarding water pollution7, resulting in the \n organic movement. One of the major forces behind this movement has been the \n \n European Union\n , which first certified \n organic food in 1991 and began reform of its \n \n \n \n \n Common Agricultural Policy\n \n \n \n  (CAP) in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies8, also known as \n decoupling.  The growth of \n organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as \n integrated pest management and \n selective breeding. Recent mainstream technological developments include \n genetically modified food.\n \n \n As of late 2007, several factors have pushed up the price of grain used to feed poultry and dairy cows and other cattle, causing higher prices of wheat (up 58%), soybean (up 32%), and maize (up 11%) over the year.910 Food \n riots have recently taken place in many countries across the world.111213 An \n epidemic of \n stem rust on \n wheat caused by race \n UG99 is currently spreading across \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Africa\n \n \n \n \n \n  and into \n \n \n \n Asia\n \n \n  and is causing major concern.141516 Approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded.17 In \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Africa\n \n \n \n \n \n , if current trends of soil degradation continue, the continent might be able to feed just 25% of its population by 2025, according to \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n UNU\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 's Ghana-based Institute for Natural Resources in Africa.18\n \n \n \n \n Practices\n \n \n \n \n \n Farmers work inside a rice field in \n \n Andhra Pradesh\n , \n \n India\n .\n \n \n \n Agricultural practices lie on a spectrum dependent upon the intensity and technology of the methods. At the one end lies the \n subsistence farmer who farms a small area with limited inputs and produces only enough \n food to meet the needs of his or her family.  At the other end lies \n intensive agriculture which includes traditional labor intensive farming (e.g. South-East Asia rice paddies), and modern agriculture which includes \n industrial agriculture, \n organic farming and \n sustainable farming. Industrial agriculture involves large fields and/or numbers of animals, high resource inputs (pesticides, fertilizers, etc.), and a high level of \n mechanization. These operations achieve \n economies of scale and require large amounts of capital in the form of land and machinery.\n \n \n The twentieth century saw changes in agricultural practice, particularly in \n agricultural chemistry and in mechanization. Agricultural chemistry includes the application of chemical fertilizer, chemical insecticides (see \n pest control), and chemical \n fungicides, analysis of soil makeup and nutritional needs of farm animals. \n \n \n Mechanization has increased farm efficiency and productivity in most regions of the world, due especially to the \n tractor and various \"gins\" (short for \"engine\") such as the \n cotton gin, semi-automatic \n balers and \n threshers and, above all, the \n combine (see \n agricultural machinery). According to the \n \n \n National Academy of Engineering\n \n  in the \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n United States\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n , agricultural mechanization is one of the 20 greatest engineering achievements of the 20th century. Early in the century, it took one American farmer to produce food for 2.5 people. By 1999, due to advances in agricultural technology, a single farmer could feed over 130 people.19\n \n \n Other recent changes in agriculture include \n hydroponics, \n plant breeding, hybridization, \n gene manipulation, better management of soil nutrients, and improved \n weed control. \n Genetic engineering has yielded crops which have capabilities beyond those of naturally occurring plants, such as higher yields and disease resistance. Modified seeds germinate faster, and thus can be grown on an accelerated schedule. Genetic engineering of plants has proven controversial, particularly in the case of \n herbicide-resistant plants. \n \n \n It has been suggested that genetic engineers may some day develop \n transgenic plants which would allow for \n irrigation, \n drainage, \n conservation, sanitary engineering, and maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossil fuel derived inputs than conventional crops.20 Such developments would be particularly important in areas which are normally arid and rely upon constant irrigation, and on large scale farms. These possibilities are questioned by ecologists and economists concerned with unsustainable GMO practices such as \n terminator seeds,2122 and a January 2008 report shows that GMO practices have failed to address sustainability issues.23 While there has been some research on sustainability using GMO crops, at least one hyped and promonant multi-year attempt by \n \n Monsanto\n  has been unsuccessful, though during the same period traditional breeding techniques yielded a more sustainable variety of the same crop.24 Additionally, a survey by the bio-tech industry of subsistence farmers in Africa to discover what GMO research would most benefit sustainable agriculture only identified non-transgenic issues as areas needing to be addressed.25\n \n \n The processing, packing and marketing of agricultural products are closely related activities also influenced by science. Methods of quick-freezing and dehydration have increased the markets for many farm products (see \n food preservation and \n meat packing industry).\n \n \n Animals, including horses, mules, oxen, camels, llamas, alpacas, and dogs, are often used to help cultivate \n fields, harvest \n crops, \n wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers. \n Animal husbandry not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, eggs, or wool) on a continual basis, but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship. \n \n \n Airplanes, helicopters, trucks, tractors, and combines are used in Western (and, increasingly, Eastern) agriculture for seeding, spraying operations for insect and disease control, harvesting, \n aerial topdressing and transporting perishable products. Radio and television disseminate vital weather reports and other information such as market reports that concern farmers. Computers have become an essential tool for farm management.\n \n \n \n \n \n Ploughing rice paddies with water buffalo, in \n \n Indonesia\n .\n \n \n \n \n \n In recent years, some aspects of intensive \n industrial agriculture have been the subject of increasing debate. The widening \n sphere of influence held by large seed and chemical companies, meat packers and food processors has been a source of concern both within the farming community and for the general public. Another issue is the type of feed given to some animals that can cause \n bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. There has also been concern over the effect of intensive agriculture on the environment.\n \n \n \n \n \n A field of ripening \n barley.\n \n \n \n \n \n The patent protection given to companies that develop new types of seed using \n genetic engineering has allowed seed to be licensed to farmers in much the same way that computer software is licensed to users. This has changed the balance of power in favor of the seed companies, allowing them to dictate terms and conditions previously unheard of. The \n \n India\n n activist and scientist \n \n Vandana Shiva\n  argues that these companies are guilty of \n biopiracy.\n \n \n \n Soil \n conservation and \n nutrient management have been important concerns since the 1950s, with the most advanced farmers taking a \n stewardship role with the land they use. However, increasing contamination of waterways and wetlands by nutrients like \n nitrogen and \n phosphorus are concerns that can only be addressed by \"enlightenment\" of farmers and/or far stricter law enforcement in many countries.\n \n \n Increasing consumer awareness of agricultural issues has led to the rise of  \n community-supported agriculture, \n local food movement, \"\n \n Slow Food\n \", and commercial \n organic farming.\n \n \n \n \n Etymology\n \n \n The word agriculture is the English adaptation of Latin agricult\u016bra, from ager, \"a field\",26 and cult\u016bra, \"\n cultivation\" in the strict sense of \"\n tillage of the soil\".27 Thus, a literal reading of the word yields \"tillage of a field / of fields\".\n \n \n \n \n History\n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n History of agriculture\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Agriculture was developed at least 10,000 years ago, and it has undergone significant developments since the time of the earliest cultivation. Evidence points to the \n \n \n \n Fertile Crescent\n \n \n  of the \n \n \n \n Middle East\n \n \n  as the site of the earliest planned sowing and harvesting of plants that had previously been gathered in the wild. Independent development of agriculture occurred in northern and southern \n China, Africa's \n \n \n Sahel\n \n , \n \n New Guinea\n  and several regions of the \n \n \n \n \n \n Americas\n \n \n \n \n . Agricultural practices such as \n irrigation, \n crop rotation, \n fertilizers, and \n pesticides were developed long ago but have made great strides in the past century. The \n Haber-Bosch method for synthesizing \n ammonium nitrate represented a major breakthrough and allowed \n crop yields to overcome previous constraints. In the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity, the substitution of labor for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, \n selective breeding, \n mechanization, \n water pollution, and \n farm subsidies. In recent years there has been a backlash against the \n external environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the \n organic movement.\n \n \n \n Ancient origins\n \n \n \n \n \n Further information: \n \n \n \n \n \n Neolithic Revolution\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ancient Egyptian farmer, copied from \n archaeologically preserved specimen by a modern artist guessing at original colors.Source: http://www.kingtutone.com\n \n \n \n \n \n Developed independently by geographically distant populations, systematic agriculture first appeared in \n \n \n Southwest Asia\n \n  with the bulk of domesticated neolthic crops and livestock now being traced to Turkey via DNA studies. The first grains of domesticated Turkish emmer wheat are found at \n Abu Hurerya dated to 13,500 BP. The only exceptions to this are barley, domesticated in two sites; in \n Levant, and East of the Zagros mountains in Iran. The eight so-called \n founder crops of agriculture appear: first \n emmer and \n einkorn wheat, then hulled \n barley, \n peas, \n lentils, \n bitter vetch, \n chick peas and \n flax.Bitter vetch and lentils along with almonds and pistachios appear in \n \n \n Franchthi Cave\n \n  Greece simultaneously, about 9,000 BC. Neither are native to Greece, and they appear 2,000 years prior to domesticated wheat in the same location. This suggests that the cultivation of legumes and nuts preceded that of grain.\n \n \n By 7000 BCE, small-scale agriculture reached \n \n Egypt\n . From at least 7000 BCE the \n Indian subcontinent saw farming of \n wheat and \n barley, as attested by archaeological excavation at \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mehrgarh\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  in \n \n \n \n \n Balochistan\n \n \n \n . By 6000 BCE, mid-scale farming was entrenched on the banks of the \n Nile. About this time, agriculture was developed independently in the Far East, with \n rice, rather than wheat, as the primary crop. \n Chinese and \n \n Indonesia\n n farmers went on to domesticate \n mung, \n soy, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n azuki\n \n \n \n \n \n  and \n taro. To complement these new sources of \n carbohydrates, highly organized net \n fishing of rivers, lakes and ocean shores in these areas brought in great volumes of essential \n protein. Collectively, these new methods of farming and fishing inaugurated a human population boom dwarfing all previous expansions, and is one that continues today.\n \n \n By 5000 BCE, the \n Sumerians had developed core agricultural techniques including large scale intensive cultivation of land, \n mono-cropping, organized \n irrigation, and use of a specialized \n labour force, particularly along the waterway now known as the \n \n Shatt al-Arab\n , from its \n \n Persian Gulf\n  delta to the confluence of the \n \n Tigris\n  and \n \n \n \n Euphrates\n \n \n . Domestication of wild \n aurochs and \n mouflon into \n cattle and \n sheep, respectively, ushered in the large-scale use of animals for food/fiber and as beasts of burden. The \n shepherd joined the farmer as an essential provider for \n sedentary and semi-\n nomadic societies.\n \n \n \n Maize, \n manioc, and \n arrowroot were first domesticated in the Americas as far back as 5200 BCE. 28 The \n potato, \n tomato,  \n pepper, \n squash, several varieties of \n bean, \n Canna, \n tobacco and several other plants were also developed in the New World, as was extensive \n terracing of steep hillsides in much of \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Andean\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n South America\n \n \n .\n \n \n In later years, the \n Greeks and \n Romans built on techniques pioneered by the Sumerians but made few fundamentally new advances. Southern Greeks struggled with very poor soils, yet managed to become a dominant society for years. The Romans were noted for an emphasis on the cultivation of crops for \n trade. \n \n \n \n \n \n A \n valve-operated \n reciprocating \n suction \n piston \n pump water-raising machine with a \n crankshaft-\n connecting rod mechanism invented by \n al-Jazari.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Middle Ages\n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n Muslim Agricultural Revolution\n \n \n During the Middle Ages, Muslim farmers in North Africa and the Near East developed and disseminated agricultural technologies including irrigation systems based on \n hydraulic and \n hydrostatic principles, the use of machines such as \n norias, and the use of water raising machines, dams, and reservoirs. They also wrote location-specific farming manuals, and were instrumental in the wider adoption of crops including sugar cane, rice, citrus fruit, apricots, cotton, artichokes, aubergines, and saffron. Muslims also brought lemons, oranges, cotton, almonds, figs and sub-tropical crops such as bananas to Spain. \n \n \n The invention of a \n three field system of crop rotation during the \n Middle Ages, and the importation of the Chinese-invented \n moldboard plow, vastly improved agricultural efficiency.\n \n \n Another important development towards the end of this period was the discovery and subsequent cultivation of fodder crops which allowed over-wintering of livestock.\n \n \n \n \n Modern era\n \n \n \n \n \n Further information: \n British Agricultural Revolution and \n Green Revolution\n \n \n \n \n A \n tractor ploughing an \n alfalfa field.\n \n \n  \n \n \n After 1492, a global exchange of previously local crops and livestock breeds occurred. Key crops involved in this exchange included the \n tomato, \n maize, \n potato, \n cocoa and \n tobacco going from the New World to the Old, and several varieties of wheat, \n spices, \n coffee, and \n sugar cane going from the Old World to the New. The most important animal exportations from the Old World to the New were those of the horse and dog (dogs were already present in the pre-Columbian Americas but not in the numbers and breeds suited to farm work). Although not usually food animals, the horse (including \n donkeys and \n ponies) and dog quickly filled essential production roles on western hemisphere farms.\n \n \n By the early 1800s, agricultural techniques, implements, seed stocks and \n cultivars had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the Middle Ages. With the rapid rise of \n mechanization in the late 19th and 20th centuries, particularly in the form of the \n tractor, farming tasks could be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible. These advances have led to efficiencies enabling certain modern farms in the United States, \n \n \n Argentina\n \n , \n \n Israel\n , \n \n Germany\n , and a few other nations to output volumes of high quality produce per land unit at what may be the practical limit.\n \n \n In 2005, the \n agricultural output of China was the largest in the world, accounting for almost one-sixth world share followed by the EU, India and the USA, according to the \n \n International Monetary Fund\n .

Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant breeders use \n greenhouses (known as glasshouses or hothouses in some areas) and other techniques to get as many as three generations of plants per year towards the continued effort of improvement.\n Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved \n pasture (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive \n X-ray an \n ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.3132\n \n \n For example, average yields of corn (\n maize) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. \n \n \n \n South America\n \n \n n average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Africa\n \n \n \n \n \n n under 1 t/ha, \n \n Egypt\n  and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as \n \n France\n  is over 8 t/ha. Variation in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical \n pest control, growth control to avoid lodging).333435\n \n \n After mechanical tomato-harvesters were developed in the early 1960s, agricultural scientists bred tomatoes that were more resistant to mechanical handling. These varieties have been criticized as being harder and having poor texture.\n More recently, \n genetic engineering has begun to be employed in large parts of the world to speed up the selection and breeding process. One widely used modification is a \n herbicide resistance gene that allows plants to tolerate exposure to \n glyphosate, a non-systemic (i.e kills all plants) chemical used to control weeds in a crop such as oilseed rape. Normally, expensive \n systemic herbicides would have to be applied to kill the weeds without harming the crop. Relatively cheap and safe glyphosate may be applied to the modified crops, efficiently killing weeds without harming the resistant crop. Another modification causes the plant to produce a toxin to reduce damage from insects (c.f. \n Starlink). This, in contrast, requires fewer insecticides to be applied to the crop.\n \n \n \n Aquaculture, the farming of \n fish, \n shrimp, and \n algae, is closely associated with agriculture.\n \n \n \n Apiculture, the culture of bees, traditionally for \n honey increasingly for crop \n pollination.\n \n \n \n \n See also : \n cultigen, \n botany, \n List of domesticated plants, \n List of vegetables, \n List of herbs, \n List of fruit\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Livestock\n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n Livestock\n \n The farming practices of livestock vary dramatically worldwide and between different types of animals. Livestock are generally kept in an enclosure, are fed by human-provided food and are intentionally bred, but some livestock are not enclosed, or are fed by access to natural foods, or are allowed to breed freely, or all three. Approximately 68% of all agricultural land is used in the production of livestock as permanent pastures.36\n \n \n \n \n Environmental impact\n \n \n \n \n \n Severe \n soil erosion in a wheat field near \n \n Washington State University\n , US (c.2005).\n \n \n Agriculture may often cause environmental problems because it changes natural environments and produces harmful by-products. Some of the negative effects are:\n \n \n \n  Loss of \n biodiversity\n \n \n  Surplus of \n nitrogen and \n phosphorus in \n rivers and \n lakes\n \n \n  Detrimental effects of \n herbicides, \n fungicides, \n insecticides, and other \n biocides\n \n \n  Conversion of natural \n ecosystems of all types into \n arable land\n \n \n  Consolidation of diverse \n biomass into a few species\n \n \n  \n Soil erosion\n \n \n  \n Deforestation\n \n \n  Depletion of \n minerals in the \n soil Many farmers practice rotational crops to ensure that the soil is not depleted of necessary minerals. \n \n \n  \n Particulate matter, including \n ammonia and \n ammonium off-gassing from animal waste contributing to \n air pollution\n \n \n  \n Air pollution from farm equipment and transportation powered by fossil fuels, \n carbon dioxide release from \n agricultural lime, as well as industrial input (fertilizers)and output (food,fuel,fiber) manufacture/processing \n \n \n  \n Weed Science - \n feral plants and animals\n \n \n  Odor from agricultural \n waste\n \n \n  \n Soil salination\n \n \n  \n \n Water crisis\n \n \n \n \n \n According to the United Nations, the livestock sector (primarily cows, chickens, and pigs) emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to our most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet.37It is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases\u2014responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO2 equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO2. It produces 65% of human-related nitrous oxide (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO2) and 37% of all human-induced methane (which is 23 times as warming as CO2). It also generates 64% of the ammonia, which contributes to acid rain and acidification of ecosystems.\n \n \n \n \n Biodiversity\n \n \n \n \n \n \n See also: \n Genetic erosion and \n Agricultural biodiversity\n \n \n \n Genetic erosion in \n crops and \n livestock biodiversity is propelled by several major factors such as variety replacement, land clearing, overexploitation of species, population pressure, environmental degradation, \n overgrazing, policy and changing agricultural systems. \n \n \n The main factor, however, is the replacement of local varieties of domestic plants and animals by high yielding or exotic varieties or species.  A large number of varieties can also often be dramatically reduced when commercial varieties (including \n GMOs) are introduced into traditional farming systems. Many researchers believe that the main problem related to agro-ecosystem management is the general tendency towards genetic and ecological uniformity imposed by the development of modern agriculture.   \n \n \n In agriculture and \n animal husbandry, the \n green revolution popularized the use of conventional \n hybridization to increase yield many folds by creating \"\n high-yielding varieties\". Often the handful of breeds of plants and animals hybridized originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the rest of the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases.  Hybridization of local breeds to improve performance may lead to the loss of the local breed over time and consequently the loss of specific genetic material due to dilution. When viewed across the world as a whole, the consequent loss in genetic diversity and biodiversity could place agriculture in a situation unable to adapt to sudden changes in the future.\n \n \n A \n Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) is an \n organism whose \n genetic material has been \n altered using the \n genetic engineering techniques generally known as \n recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has vastly expanded the repertoire of genes available to breeders to create the desired properties in future germlines. However, it is hypothesised that these new strains will replace the wild-type species beyond their original fields, and that these genes may be transferred to other plant species that were not intended.\n \n \n \n \n Lunar Farming\n \n \n \n Lunar farming is the practice of observing the moon's phases to assist in making decisions on when to plant various crops. Root crops are believed to be best planted during the waning phase of the moon (when the moon is decreasing in size) while above ground crops are said to be best planted during the waxing moon (when the moon is growing in size). \n \n \n Besides these phases, the constellation of the zodiac through which the moon is passing is also observed. This is used to make further timing decisions for various farming operations. For instance, when the moon is in Cancer it is believed to be the best time to sow seeds and start planting, however when it is in Aries, a barren sign, planting should be avoided.\n \n \n The moon's gravitation is known to affect large bodies of water on the earth such as seas and oceans creating tides. It is conjectured that it also produces effects on a smaller scale; affecting the water contained in soils and plants. This explains the mechanism buy which plants are affected by the phases of the moon.\n \n \n \n \n Policy\n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n Agricultural policy\n \n \n Agricultural policy focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include:\n \n \n \n \n Food safety: Ensuring that the food supply is free of contamination.\n \n \n \n Food security: Ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs.3839\n \n \n \n Food quality: Ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality.\n \n \n  Poverty Reduction\n \n \n  Conservation\n \n \n  Environmental impact\n \n \n  Economic stability\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Agriculture and petroleum\n \n \n \n \n \n Further information: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Effect of biofuels on food prices\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n Since the 1940s, agriculture has dramatically increased its productivity, due largely to the use of petrochemical derived \n pesticides, fertilizers, and increased \n mechanization.  This has allowed \n world population to grow more than double over the last 50 years. Every energy unit delivered in food grown using modern techniques requires over ten energy units to produce and deliver.  The vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources.  Because of modern agriculture's current heavy reliance on petrochemicals and mechanization, there are warnings that the ever decreasing supply of oil (the dramatic nature of which is known as \n peak oil4041424344) will inflict major damage on the modern industrial agriculture system, and could cause large food shortages.45\n \n \n Oil shortages are one of several factors making \n organic agriculture and other \n sustainable farming methods necessary. This conversion is now occurring, but the reconditioning of soil to restore nutrients lost during the use of \n monoculture agriculture techniques made possible by petroleum-based technology will take time. Some farmers using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields as high as those available from conventional farming (but without the use of fossil-fuel-intensive artificial fertilizers or pesticides).46474849  \n \n \n Farmers have also begun raising crops such as corn (maize) for non-food use in an effort to help \n mitigate peak oil. This has contributed to a 60% rise in wheat prices recently, and has been indicated as a possible precursor to \"serious social unrest in developing countries.\"39  Such situations would be exacerbated in the event of future rises in food and fuel costs, factors which have already impacted the ability of charitable donors to send food aid to starving populations.38 \n \n \n One example of the chain reactions which could possibly be caused by peak oil issues involves the problems caused by farmers raising crops such as corn (maize) for non-food use in an effort to help \n mitigate peak oil. This has already lowered food production.50 This \n food vs fuel issue will be exacerbated as demand for ethanol fuel rises. Rising food and fuel costs has already limited the abilities of some charitable donors to send food aid to starving populations.51 In the UN, some warn that the recent 60% rise in wheat prices could cause \"serious social unrest in developing countries.\"5052 In 2007, higher incentives for farmers to grow non-food \n biofuel crops53 combined with other factors (such as over-development of former farm lands, rising transportation costs, \n climate change, growing consumer demand in \n China and \n \n India\n , and \n population growth)54 to cause \n food shortages in \n \n \n \n Asia\n \n \n , the \n \n \n \n Middle East\n \n \n , \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Africa\n \n \n \n \n \n , and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mexico\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n , as well as rising \n food prices around the globe.5556 As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. Some of these shortages resulted in \n food riots and even deadly stampedes.575859\n \n \n Another major petroleum issue in agriculture is the effect of petroleum supplies will have on fertilizer production. By far the biggest fossil fuel input to agriculture is the use of natural gas as a hydrogen source for the \n Haber-Bosch fertilizer-creation process.60 Natural gas is used because it is the cheapest currently available source of hydrogen.6162  When oil production becomes so scarce that natural gas is used as a partial stopgap replacement, and hydrogen use in transportation increases, natural gas will \n become much more expensive. If other sources of hydrogen are not available to replace the Haber process, in amounts sufficient to supply transportation and agricultural needs, this major source of fertilizer would either become extremely expensive or unavailable. This would either cause food shortages or dramatic rises in food prices.\n \n \n \n Mitigation of effects of petroleum shortages\n \n \n One effect oil shortages could have on agriculture is a full return to \n organic agriculture. In light of peak oil concerns, organic methods are much more sustainable than contemporary practices because they use no petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Some farmers using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields as high as those available from conventional farming.63646566 Organic farming may however be more \n labor-intensive and would require a shift of work force from urban to rural areas.67 \n \n \n It has been suggested that rural communities might obtain fuel from the \n biochar and \n synfuel process, which uses agricultural waste to provide charcoal fertilizer, some fuel and food, instead of the normal \n food vs fuel debate. As the synfuel would be used on site, the process would be more efficient and may just provide enough fuel for a new organic-agriculture fusion.6869\n \n \n It has been suggested that some \n transgenic plants may some day be developed which would allow for maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossil fuel derived inputs than conventional crops.70 The possibility of success of these programs is questioned by ecologists and economists concerned with unsustainable GMO practices such as \n terminator seeds,7172 and a January 2008 report shows that GMO practices \"fail to deliver environmental,\n social and economic benefits.\"73 While there has been some research on sustainability using GMO crops, at least one hyped and prominent multi-year attempt by \n \n Monsanto\n  has been unsuccessful, though during the same period traditional breeding techniques yielded a more sustainable variety of the same crop.74 Additionally, a survey by the bio-tech industry of subsistence farmers in Africa to discover what GMO research would most benefit sustainable agriculture only identified non-transgenic issues as areas needing to be addressed.75\n Nonetheless, some governments in Africa continue to view investments in new transgenic technologies as an essential component of efforts to improve sustainability.76\n \n \n \n \n \n Agriculture safety and health\n \n \n \n \n \n Satellite image of circular crop fields characteristic of \n center pivot irrigation in \n \n Haskell County, Kansas\n  in late June 2001. Healthy, growing crops are green. \n Maize is growing leafy stalks, but \n Sorghum, which resembles maize, grows more slowly and is much smaller and therefore paler. \n Wheat is a brilliant gold as harvest occurs in June. Brown fields have been recently harvested and plowed under or lie \n fallow for the year.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n United States\n \n \n Agriculture ranks among the most hazardous industries.77 Farmers are at high risk for fatal and nonfatal injuries, work-related lung diseases, noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, and certain cancers associated with chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. Farming is one of the few industries in which the families (who often share the work and live on the premises) are also at risk for injuries, illness, and death. \n \n \n \n \n \n  In an average year, 516 workers die doing farm work in the U.S. (1992-2005). Of these deaths, 101 are caused by tractor overturns.\n \n \n  Every day, about 243 agricultural workers suffer lost-work-time injuries, and about 5% of these result in permanent impairment.78\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Young workers\n \n \n Agriculture is the most dangerous industry for young workers, accounting for 42% of all work-related fatalities of young workers in the U.S. between 1992 and 2000. Unlike other industries, half the young victims in agriculture were under age 15. 79\n \n \n For young agricultural workers aged 15\u201317, the risk of fatal injury is four times the risk for young workers in other workplaces 80 Agricultural work exposes young workers to safety hazards such as machinery, confined spaces, work at elevations, and work around livestock. \n \n \n \n \n \n  An estimated 1.26 million children and adolescents under 20 years of age resided on farms in 2004, with about 699,000 of these youth performing work on the farms. In addition to the youth who live on farms, an additional 337,000 children and adolescents were hired to work on U.S. farms in 2004.\n \n \n  On average, 103 children are killed annually on farms (1990-1996). Approximately 40 percent of these deaths were work-related.\n \n \n  In 2004, an estimated 27,600 children and adolescents were injured on farms; 8,100 of these injuries were due to farm work.78\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Additional information\n \n \n \n See also\n \n \n \n \n  Main lists: \n List of basic agriculture topics and \n List of agriculture topics\n \n \n \n \n \n Part of a series on\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n Gardening\n \n \n \n \n Gardening \u2022\n \n Garden \u2022\n \n Botanical garden \u2022\n \n Arboretum \u2022\n \n Botany \u2022\n \n Plant\n \n \n \n Horticulture\n \n \n \n \n Horticulture \u2022\n \n Agriculture \u2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Urban agriculture\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \u2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n City farm\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \u2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Organic farming\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \u2022\n \n Herb farm \u2022\n \n Hobby farm \u2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Intercropping\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \u2022\n \n Farm\n \n \n \n Customs\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Harvest festival\n \n \n \n \n \n  \u2022\n \n Thanksgiving \u2022\n \n History of agriculture\n \n \n \n Plant protection\n \n \n \n \n Phytopathology \u2022\n \n Pesticide \u2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Weed control\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Aeroponics\n \n \n  \n Agricultural Engineering \n \n \n  \n Agrocenter\n \n \n  \n Agricultural effects of peak oil\n \n \n  \n Apiculture\n \n \n  \n Climate change and agriculture\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n Dismal Science\n \n \n \n \n  - highlighting that only continuous advancement in agricultural science avoids a Malthusian catastrophe\n \n \n  \n Geoponic\n \n \n  \n Green Revolution\n \n \n  \n Horticulture\n \n \n  \n Hydroponic\n \n \n  \n \n Industrial agriculture\n \n \n \n  \n Integrated Pest Management (\n IPM)\n \n \n  \n List of countries by GDP sector composition - a breakdown that includes Agricultural sector information\n \n \n  \n List of domesticated animals\n \n \n  \n List of subsistence techniques\n \n \n  \n List of sustainable agriculture topics\n \n \n  \n No-till farming\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Organic farming\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Permaculture\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Timeline of agriculture and food technology.\n \n \n  \n Vertical farming\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Notes\n \n \n \n \n \n Marketwatch (2007) \n Plastics are Green in More Ways Than One.\n \n BIO (n.d.) \n Growing Plants for Pharmaceutical Production vs. for Food and Feed Crops.\n \n \n \n \n International Labour Organization\n \n  \n Key Indicators of the Labour Market 2008, \n p.11-12\n \n \"[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Econ https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Econ]\".\n \n New York Times (2005) \n Sometimes a Bumper Crop is Too Much Of a Good Thing\n \n New York Times (1986) \n Science Academy Recommends Resumption of Natural Farming\n \n The World Bank (1995) \n Overcoming Agricultural Water Pollution in the European Union\n \n European Commission (2003) \n CAP Reform\n \n  New York Times (2007 September) \n At Tyson and Kraft, Grain Costs Limit Profit\n \n \n Forget oil, the new global crisis is food\n \n \n Riots and hunger feared as demand for grain sends food costs soaring\n \n \n Already we have riots, hoarding, panic: the sign of things to come?\n \n \n Feed the world?

Princess Louise was the wife of the \n Marquess of Lorne,  \n Governor General of Canada from 1878 to 1883. \n \n Lake Louise\n , the village of \n \n Caroline\n , and \n \n Mount Alberta\n  were also named in honour of Princess Louise.\n \n \n \n  Geography \n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n Geography of Alberta\n \n Alberta is located in \n western Canada and covers an area of 661,848 square kilometres (255,541 sq mi), an area about 5% smaller than \n \n \n Texas\n \n  or 20% larger than \n France.2 This makes it the fourth largest province after \n \n Quebec\n , \n \n Ontario\n , and \n \n British Columbia\n . To the south, the province borders on the \n \n \n \n \n 49th parallel north\n \n \n \n , separating it from the U.S. state of \n \n \n \n \n \n Montana\n \n \n \n \n , while on the north the \n \n \n \n \n 60th parallel north\n \n \n \n  divides it from the \n \n Northwest Territories\n . To the east the \n \n \n \n \n 110th meridian west\n \n \n \n  separates it from the province of \n \n Saskatchewan\n , while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 120th meridian west\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  south from the Northwest Territories at 60\u00b0N until it reaches the \n \n \n \n \n Great Divide\n \n \n \n  at the \n \n \n Rocky Mountains\n \n , and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the \n continental divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49\u00b0N.\n \n \n The province extends 1,223 kilometres (760 mi) north to south and 660 kilometres (410 mi) east to west at its maximum width. Its highest point is 3,747 metres (12,290 ft) at the summit of \n Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border, while its lowest point is 152 metres (500 ft) on the \n \n Slave River\n  in \n \n Wood Buffalo National Park\n  in the northeast.3\n \n \n With the exception of the southeastern section, the province has adequate \n water resources. Alberta contains numerous \n rivers and \n lakes used for \n swimming, \n water skiing, \n fishing and a full range of other \n water sports. There are three large lakes and a multitude of smaller lakes less than 260 km\u00b2 each. Part of \n \n Lake Athabasca\n  ( -1000000000007898.0000007,898 km\u00b2) lies in the province of Saskatchewan. \n Lake Claire ( -1000000000001436.0000001,436 km\u00b2) lies just west of Lake Athabasca in \n \n Wood Buffalo National Park\n . \n \n Lesser Slave Lake\n  ( -1000000000001168.0000001,168 km\u00b2) is northwest of \n \n Edmonton\n . The longest river in Alberta is the \n \n Athabasca River\n  which travels 1,538 kilometres (956 mi) from the \n Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca.4\n \n \n \n \n \n Alberta's capital city, \n \n Edmonton\n , is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province, with most of western Canada's oil \n refinery capacity located nearby, in close proximity to most of Canada's largest \n oil fields. Edmonton is the most northerly major city in Canada, and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada. Alberta's other major city, \n \n Calgary\n , is located approximately 280 kilometres (170 mi) south of Edmonton and 240 kilometres (150 mi) north of Montana, surrounding by extensive \n ranching country. Almost 75% of the province's population lives in the \n \n \n \n \n Calgary-Edmonton Corridor\n \n \n \n , in and between the two major cities.\n \n \n Most of the northern half of the province is \n boreal forest, while the \n \n \n Rocky Mountains\n \n  along the southwestern boundary are largely forested. The southern quarter of the province is \n prairie, ranging from \n shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it. The central \n aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests, from Calgary, north to Edmonton, and then east to \n \n Lloydminster\n , contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population. Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to \n grain or to \n dairy farming, with \n mixed farming more common in the north and centre, while \n ranching and \n irrigated agriculture predominate in the south.5\n \n \n The Alberta \n badlands are located in southeastern Alberta, where the \n \n \n \n Red Deer River\n \n \n  crosses the flat prairie and farmland, and features deep \n gorges and striking landforms. \n \n Dinosaur Provincial Park\n , near \n \n Brooks, Alberta\n , showcases the badlands terrain, \n desert \n flora, and remnants from Alberta's past when \n dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape.\n \n \n Alberta is one of only two Canadian provinces to have no maritime coast (the other being the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan.)\n \n \n \n \n Climate\n \n \n Alberta has a dry \n continental climate with warm summers and cold winters. The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter. As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta, temperature can change rapidly. Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from \u221254 \u00b0C (\u221270 \u00b0F) in northern Alberta to \u221246 \u00b0C (\u221250 \u00b0F) in southern Alberta. In the summer, continental air masses produce maximum temperatures from 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) in the mountains to 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in southern Alberta.6\n \n \n Because Alberta extends for over 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) from north to south, it is natural that its climate should vary considerably. Average temperatures in January range from \u22128 \u00b0C (20 \u00b0F) in the south to \u221224 \u00b0C (\u221210 \u00b0F) in the north, and in July from 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in the south to 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in the north.  The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest, which disrupt the flow of the \n prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a \n rain shadow over much of Alberta. The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the \n Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean. Annual precipitation ranges from 300 millimetres (12 in) in the southeast to 450 millimetres (18 in) in the north, except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where rainfall can reach 600 millimetres (24 in) annually.3\n In the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F) in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north to near 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in the dry prairie of the southeast. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures. The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting for several years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation. \n Alberta is a sunny province. Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1900 and 2500 hours per year. Northern Alberta receives about 18 hours of daylight in the summer.\n The long summer days make summer the sunniest season of the year in Alberta.6\n \n \n In southwestern Alberta, the winter cold is frequently interrupted by warm, dry \n chinook winds blowing from the mountains, which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period of time. During one chinook recorded at \n Pincher Creek, temperatures soared from \u221218.9 \u00b0C (\u22120 \u00b0F) to 3.3 \u00b0C (40 \u00b0F) in one hour.3  The region around \n \n Lethbridge\n  has the most chinooks, averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year, while \n \n Calgary\n  has a \n white Christmas only 59% of the time as a result of these winds.\n \n \n Northern Alberta is mostly covered by \n boreal forest and has fewer frost-free days than southern Alberta due to its \n subarctic climate. The agricultural area of southern Alberta has a \n semiarid climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that \n evaporates or is used by plants. The southeastern corner of Alberta, known as the \n Palliser Triangle, experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province, and as a result suffers frequent \n crop yield problems and occasional severe \n droughts. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter \n chinook winds. Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely \n aspen parkland, a \n biome transitional between \n prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north. After southern \n \n Ontario\n , Central Alberta is the most likely region in Canada to experience \n tornadoes. \n Thunderstorms, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the \n \n \n \n \n Calgary-Edmonton Corridor\n \n \n \n  is notable for having the highest frequency of \n hail in Canada, which is caused by \n orographic lifting from the nearby Rocky Mountains, enhancing the updraft/downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail.\n \n \n \n \n  History \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n History of Alberta\n \n The  province of Alberta, as far north as about 53\u00b0 north latitude, was a part of \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Rupert's Land\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  from the time of the incorporation of the \n \n Hudson's Bay Company\n  (1670). After the arrival in the North-West of the French around 1731 they settled the prairies of the west, establishing communities such as \n \n Lac La Biche\n  and \n \n Bonnyville\n . Fort La Jonqui\u00e8re was established near what is now Calgary in 1752. The \n \n \n North West Company\n \n  of \n \n Montreal\n  occupied the northern part of Alberta territory before the Hudson's Bay Company arrived from Hudson Bay to take possession of it. The first explorer of the Athabasca region was \n \n \n \n \n Peter Pond\n \n \n \n , who, on behalf of the North West Company of Montreal, built \n Fort Athabasca on Lac La Biche in 1778. \n Roderick Mackenzie built \n Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir \n Alexander Mackenzie followed the \n \n North Saskatchewan River\n  to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name\u2014the \n \n Mackenzie River\n \u2014which he followed to its outlet in the \n Arctic Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the \n \n Peace River\n  upstream, eventually reaching the \n Pacific Ocean, and so he became the first white man to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.7\n \n \n The district of Alberta was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905 the district of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status, with the election of \n \n Alexander Cameron Rutherford\n  as the first premier.\n \n \n \n \n  Demographics \n \n \n \n \n \n Alberta's population has grown steadily for over a century.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n Demographics of Alberta\n \n Alberta has enjoyed a relatively high rate of growth in recent years, mainly because of its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province had high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as \n \n British Columbia\n ), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces.8\n Approximately 81% of the population live in urban areas and only about 19% live in rural areas. The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of Canada.9 Many of Alberta's cities and towns have also experienced very high rates of growth in recent history. Over the past century, Alberta's population rose from 73,022 in 1901 to 2,974,807 in 200110 and 3,290,350 according to the \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2006 census\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n .11\n \n \n \n  Languages \n \n \n \n \n \n Albertans have many different mother tongues. English is by far the most common, while French is rare.12\n \n \n \n The \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2006 census\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  found that \n \n English\n , with 2,576,670 native speakers, was the mother tongue of 79.99% of Albertans. The next most common mother tongues were \n Chinese languages with 97,275 native-speakers (3.02%); followed by \n \n German\n  with 84,505 native-speakers (2.62%); and \n \n French\n  with 61,225 (1.90%); then \n \n Punjabi\n  36,320 (1.13%); \n \n Tagalog\n  29,740 (0.92%); \n \n Ukrainian\n  29,455 (0.91%); \n \n Spanish\n  29,125 (0.90%); and \n \n Polish\n  21,990 (0.68%); \n Arabic 20,495 (0.64%); \n \n Dutch\n  19,980 (0.62%); and \n \n Vietnamese\n  19,350 (0.60%).

In line with the rest of Canada, many immigrants originated from \n \n Scotland\n , \n \n Ireland\n  and \n \n Wales\n , but large numbers also came from other parts of \n Europe, notably \n Germans, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n French\n \n \n \n \n \n , \n \n Ukrainians\n  and \n Scandinavians. According to Statistics Canada, Alberta is home to the second highest proportion (two percent) of \n Francophones in western Canada (after \n \n Manitoba\n ). Many of \n Alberta's French-speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province. As reported in the 2001 census, the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Alberta's population, and East Indians represented more than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic \n \n \n \n \n Chinatown\n \n \n \n s, and Calgary has Canada's third largest Chinese community. The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s.  \n Aboriginal Albertans make up approximately three percent of the population.\n \n \n In the 2001 Canadian census, 387,445 Albertans (13.17%) identified themselves as \n \"Canadian\" while 426,035 (14.49%) identified some other ethnicity as well as \"Canadian\", making a total of 813,485 (27.66%) for \"Canadian\". The other most commonly reported ethnicities were: 753,185 \n English (25.61%); and 576,350 \n German (19.60%); 556,575 \n \n Scottish\n  (18.92%); 461,065 \n \n Irish\n  (15.68%); 332,675 \n \n French\n  (11.31%); 285,725 \n \n Ukrainian\n  (9.71%); 149,225 \n \n Dutch\n  (5.07%); 144,040 \n North American Indian (4.90%); 137,625 \n \n Polish\n  (4.68%); 120,050 \n \n \n \n Norwegian\n \n \n  (4.08%); and 108,050 \n \n Chinese\n  (3.67%). (Each person could choose more than one ethnicity.)15\n \n \n Amongst those of British origins, the \n \n Scots\n  have had a particularly strong influence on place-names, with the names of many cities and towns including Calgary, \n \n Airdrie\n , \n Canmore, and \n \n Banff\n ) having \n Scottish origins.\n \n \n \n \n  Religion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ambox-content\" style=\"\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  This section needs additional  for .\n Please help \n improve this article by adding .

The per capita GDP in 2007 was by far the highest of any province in Canada at \n \n C$\n 74,825. This was 61% higher than the national average of \n \n C$\n 46,441 and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces. In 2006 the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history.18 According to the 2006 census,19 the median annual family income after taxes was $70,986 in Alberta (compared to $60,270 in Canada as a whole). \n \n \n The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. The region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres north to south. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).20 It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by \n TD Bank Financial Group found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian style quality of life, offering \n universal health care benefits. The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.\n \n \n According to the \n \n \n \n \n Fraser Institute\n \n \n \n , Alberta also has very high levels of \n economic freedom. It is by far the most free economy in Canada,21 and is rated as the 2nd most free economy of U.S. states and Canadian provinces.22\n \n \n \n  Industry \n \n \n \n \n \n Mildred Lake mine site and plant at the \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Athabasca Oil Sands\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n Alberta is the largest producer of \n conventional crude oil, \n synthetic crude, \n natural gas and gas products in the country. Alberta is the world's 2nd largest exporter of natural gas and the 4th largest producer.23 Two of the largest producers of \n petrochemicals in \n \n \n \n North America\n \n \n  are located in central and north central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton, world class \n polyethylene and \n vinyl manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's \n oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large \n petrochemical industry to the east of Edmonton.\n \n \n The \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Athabasca Oil Sands\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  (sometimes known as the Athabasca \n Tar sands) have estimated \n non-conventional oil reserves approximately equal to the \n conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6 trillion barrels (254 km\u00b3). With the development of new extraction methods such as \n steam assisted gravity drainage, which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional \n strip mining and non-conventional \n in situ methods to extract the \n bitumen from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about 315 billion barrels (50 km\u00b3) of bitumen are recoverable. \n \n \n \n \n \n Fort McMurray\n \n \n \n \n , one of Canada's fastest growing  cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.24\n \n \n Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the Tar Sands is the price of oil. The \n oil price increases since 2003 have made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.\n \n \n With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive \n liquid crystal display systems.25 With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.\n \n \n \n \n  Agriculture and forestry \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Agriculture has a significant position in the province's economy. The province has over three million head of \n cattle,26 and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains \n \n \n buffalo (bison)\n \n  for the consumer market. \n Sheep for \n wool and \n mutton are also raised.\n \n \n \n \n \n Grain elevator in \n southern Alberta\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Wheat and \n canola are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production; other \n grains are also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common \n grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing; farmers typically truck the grain to central points.\n \n \n Alberta is the leading \n beekeeping province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering \n hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the \n Peace River valley where the season is short but the working days are long for \n honeybees to produce honey from \n clover and \n fireweed. \n Hybrid canola also requires \n bee \n pollination, and some beekeepers service this need.\n \n \n The vast northern \n forest reserves of \n softwood allow Alberta to produce large quantities of \n lumber, \n oriented strand board (OSB) and \n plywood, and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the \n Pacific Rim \n nations with bleached \n wood pulp and \n newsprint.\n \n \n \n \n  Tourism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n Tourism in Alberta\n \n Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century, with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing, hiking and camping, shopping locales such as \n \n West Edmonton Mall\n ,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Calgary Stampede\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n , outdoor festivals, professional athletic events, international sporting competitions such as the \n \n \n Commonwealth Games\n \n  and \n \n \n \n \n Olympic Games\n \n \n \n , as well as more eclectic attractions. There are also natural attractions like \n \n Elk Island National Park\n , \n \n Wood Buffalo National Park\n , and the \n Columbia Icefield.\n \n \n According to Alberta Economic Development, Edmonton and Calgary both host over four million visitors annually. Banff, Jasper and the Rocky Mountains are visited by about three million people per year.27\n \n \n \n \n \n Alberta's Rocky Mountains include well known tourist destinations \n \n Banff National Park\n  and \n \n Jasper National Park\n . The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic \n \n Icefields Parkway\n . Banff is located 128 km west of Calgary on \n \n Highway 1\n , and Jasper is located 366 km west of Edmonton on \n \n Yellowhead Highway\n . Five of Canada's fourteen \n \n \n UNESCO\n \n  \n World heritage sites are located within the province: \n \n Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks\n , \n \n Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park\n , Wood Buffalo National Park, \n \n Dinosaur Provincial Park\n  and \n \n \n Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump\n \n .\n \n \n About 1.2 million people pass through the gates of Calgary's world-famous Stampede,28 a celebration of Canada's own \n Wild West and the cattle ranching industry. About 800,000 people enjoy Edmonton's \n Capital Ex (formerly Klondike Days).29 Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the \n \n Yukon\n  \n gold fields, and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous \n \n Chilkoot Pass\n .\n \n \n Another tourist destination that draws more than 650,000 visitors each year is the Drumheller Valley, located northeast of Calgary. Drumheller, \"Dinosaur Capital of The World\", offers the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canada's largest coal producers during the war years. The Canadian Badlands has much to offer in the way of attractions, cultural events, celebrations, accommodations and service.\n \n \n Located in east-central Alberta is \n \n \n \n \n Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions\n \n \n \n , a popular tourist attraction operated out of \n \n Stettler\n . It boasts one of the few operable steam trains in the world, offering trips through the rolling prairie scenery. Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year.\n \n \n Alberta is an important destination for tourists who love to \n ski and \n hike; Alberta boasts several world-class \n ski resorts such as \n \n Sunshine Village\n , \n \n Lake Louise\n , \n \n Marmot Basin\n , \n \n Norquay\n  and \n \n Nakiska\n . Hunters and fishermen from around the world are able to take home impressive \n trophies and \n tall tales from their experiences in Alberta's wilderness.\n \n \n \n \n Taxation\n \n \n The province's revenue comes mainly from the taxation of oil, natural gas, beef, softwood lumber, and wheat, but also includes a tax on corporate and personal income, gaming revenue, and grants from the \n \n \n federal government\n \n  primarily for \n infrastructure projects. Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial \n sales tax (though residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the \n Goods and Services Tax). Alberta's municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments which (usually) work in co-operation with the provincial government.\n \n \n \n \n \n  Transportation \n \n \n \n \n \n  David Thompson Highway outside of \n \n Banff National Park\n \n \n \n \n Alberta has over 180,000 km of \n highways and roads, of which nearly 50,000 km are paved. The main north-south \n corridor is \n \n Highway 2\n , which begins south of \n \n Cardston\n  at the \n \n \n \n \n \n Carway\n \n \n \n \n  border crossing and is part of the \n \n \n \n CANAMEX Corridor\n \n \n . \n \n Highway 4\n , which effectively extends \n \n Interstate 15\n  into Alberta and is the busiest U.S. gateway to the province, begins at the \n \n Coutts\n  border crossing and ends at Lethbridge. \n \n \n \n \n Highway 3\n \n \n \n  joins Lethbridge to \n \n Fort Macleod\n  and links Highway 4 to Highway 2. Highway 2 travels northward through Fort Macleod, Calgary, Red Deer, and Edmonton before dividing into two highways. The section of Highway 2 between Calgary and Edmonton has been named the \n Queen Elizabeth II Highway to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005. Past Edmonton, one branch continues northwest as \n \n Highway 43\n  into Grande Prairie and the \n \n \n \n Peace River Country\n \n \n ; the other (\n \n Highway 63\n ) travels northeast to Fort McMurray, the location of the \n Athabasca Oil Sands. Highway 2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it: \n \n Highway 22\n , west of highway 2, known as \"the cowboy trail,\" and \n \n Highway 21\n , east of highway 2.\n \n \n Alberta has two main east-west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the \n \n Trans-Canada Highway\n  system, enters the province near Medicine Hat, runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through \n \n Banff National Park\n . The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network but known alternatively as the \n \n Yellowhead Highway\n  (\n \n Highway 16\n ), runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and \n \n Jasper National Park\n  into \n \n British Columbia\n . One of the most scenic drives is along the \n \n Icefields Parkway\n , which runs for 228 km between Jasper and Lake Louise, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length.\n \n \n \n \n \n Current \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Alberta licence plate\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Another major corridor through central Alberta is \n \n Highway 11\n  (also known as the \n David Thompson Highway), which runs west from the \n \n \n \n \n \n Saskatchewan River Crossing\n \n \n \n \n  in Banff National Park through \n Rocky Mountain House and \n Red Deer, connecting with \n \n Highway 12\n  20 km west of \n Stettler.  The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton, as it crosses Highway 2 just west of Red Deer.\n \n \n Urban stretches of Alberta's major highways and \n freeways are often called trails. For example, Highway 2, the main north-south highway in the province, is called \n \n \n \n Deerfoot Trail\n \n \n  as it passes through Calgary but becomes \n \n \n \n Calgary Trail\n \n \n  as it enters Edmonton and then turns into Saint Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton for the city of \n St. Albert. Calgary, in particular, has a tradition of calling its largest urban \n expressways trails and naming many of them after prominent \n first nations individuals and tribes, such as \n \n \n \n Crowchild Trail\n \n \n , Deerfoot Trail, and \n Stoney Trail.\n \n \n \n \n \n See also: \n List of Alberta provincial highways\n \n \n Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial \n public transit systems. In addition to buses, Edmonton and Calgary operate \n light rail transit (LRT) systems. \n Edmonton LRT, which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside of it, was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in North America, while the Calgary \n \n C-Train\n , although operating mostly on the surface, has almost 3 and a half times as much track as the Edmonton LRT and the highest ridership of any LRT system in North America.\n \n \n Alberta is well-connected by air, with \n international airports at both Edmonton and Calgary. \n \n Calgary International Airport\n  and \n \n Edmonton International Airport\n  are the fourth and fifth \n busiest in Canada respectively. Calgary's \n airport is a hub for \n \n WestJet Airlines\n  and a regional hub for \n \n Air Canada\n . Calgary's airport primarily serves the Canadian prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) for connecting flights to British Columbia, eastern Canada, 15 major US centres, nine European airports, and four destinations in \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mexico\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  and the \n \n \n \n \n \n Caribbean\n \n \n \n \n .30  Edmonton's airport acts as a hub for the Canadian north and has connections to all major Canadian airports as well as 10 major US airports, 3 European airports and 6 Mexican and Caribbean airports.\n \n \n \n \n \n See also: \n List of airports in Alberta\n \n \n There are over 9,000 km of operating mainline railway, and many tourists see Alberta aboard \n Via Rail or \n \n \n \n \n Rocky Mountaineer\n \n \n \n . The \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Canadian Pacific Railway\n \n \n \n \n \n  and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Canadian National Railway\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  companies operate railway \n freight across the province.\n \n \n \n \n  Government \n \n \n \n \n \n Main articles: \n Politics of Alberta and \n \n Monarchy in Alberta\n \n \n \n The government of Alberta is organized as a \n parliamentary \n democracy with a unicameral legislature.  Its \n unicameral legislature\u2014the \n \n Legislative Assembly\n \u2014consists of eighty-three members.\n \n \n Locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately. Their boundaries do not necessarily coincide.  Municipalities where the same body act as both local government and school board are formally referred to as \"counties\" in Alberta.\n \n \n As Canada's \n head of state, \n Queen Elizabeth II, is the head of state for the Government of Alberta. Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor Norman Kwong.  Although the lieutenant governor is technically the most powerful person in Alberta, he is in reality a \n figurehead whose actions are restricted by custom and \n constitutional convention.  The government is therefore headed by the \n \n premier\n . The current premier is Ed Stelmach who was elected as leader of the governing Progressive Conservatives on December 2, 2006.  Stelmach was sworn in as the 13th \n \n Premier of Alberta\n  on December 15, 2006. \n \n \n Alberta's Legislative Building in Edmonton.\n \n \n \n The Premier is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, and he draws all the members of his Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly.\n \n \n The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial government\u2014the capital of Alberta.\n \n \n Alberta's elections tend to yield results which are much more conservative than those of other Canadian provinces. Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the Progressive Conservatives (\"Conservatives\" or \"Tories\"), the \n \n Liberals\n , and the social democratic \n \n New Democrats\n . A fourth party, the strongly conservative \n \n Social Credit Party\n , was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971. Since that time, no other political party has governed Alberta. In fact, only four parties have governed Alberta: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the \n \n \n \n \n \n \n United Farmers of Alberta\n \n \n \n \n \n , from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, and the currently governing Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to the present.\n \n \n Alberta has had occasional surges in \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n separatist sentiment\n \n \n \n \n \n \n . Even during the 1980s, when these feelings were at their strongest, there has never been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movements or referendums. There are several groups wishing to promote the independence of Alberta in some form currently active in the province.\n \n \n In the \n \n 2008 provincial election\n , held on March 3, 2008, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government with 72 of 83 seats, the \n \n Alberta Liberal Party\n  was elected as the Official Opposition with nine members, and the \n \n Alberta New Democratic Party\n  elected two members.31 \n \n \n \n \n \n See also: \n List of Alberta Premiers and \n List of Alberta general elections\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Municipalities\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Airdrie\n \n \n \n Brooks\n \n \n \n Calgary\n \n \n \n Camrose\n \n \n \n Cold Lake\n \n \n \n Edmonton\n \n \n \n Fort Saskatchewan\n \n \n \n Grande Prairie\n \n \n \n Leduc\n \n \n \n Lethbridge\n \n \n \n Lloydminster\n \n \n Medicine Hat\n \n \n Red Deer\n \n \n \n Spruce Grove\n \n \n St. Albert\n \n Wetaskiwin\n \n \n \n Alberta Cities\n \n \n \n ----\n Distribution of cities in Alberta\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Largest municipalities and metro areas by population\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Census Metropolitan Areas:\n \n 2006\n \n 2001\n \n 1996\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n Calgary CMA\n \n \n \n \n 1,079,310\n \n 951,395\n \n 821,628\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Edmonton CMA\n \n \n \n \n \n 1,034,945\n \n 937,845\n \n 862,597\n \n \n \n Cities (10 Largest):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n Calgary\n \n \n 1,019,942\n \n 878,866\n \n 768,082\n \n \n \n  \n \n Edmonton\n \n \n 730,372\n \n 666,104\n \n 616,306\n \n \n \n  \n \n Red Deer\n \n \n 82,772\n \n 67,707\n \n 60,080\n \n \n \n  \n \n Lethbridge\n \n \n 74,637\n \n 67,374\n \n 63,053\n \n \n \n  \n \n St. Albert\n (included in Edmonton CMA)\n \n 57,719\n \n 53,081\n \n 46,888\n \n \n \n  \n Medicine Hat\n \n 56,997\n \n 51,249\n \n 46,783\n \n \n \n  \n \n Grande Prairie\n \n \n 47,076\n \n 36,983\n \n 31,353\n \n \n \n  \n \n Airdrie\n (included in Calgary CMA)\n \n 28,927\n \n 20,382\n \n 15,946\n \n \n \n  \n \n Spruce Grove\n (included in Edmonton CMA)\n \n 19,496\n \n 15,983\n \n 14,271\n \n \n \n  \n \n Leduc\n (included in Edmonton CMA)\n \n 16,967\n \n 15,032\n \n 14,346\n \n \n \n Districts (3 Largest):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n Strathcona County\n (included in Edmonton CMA)\n \n 82,511\n \n 71,986\n \n 64,176\n \n \n \n  \n \n Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo\n \n \n 51,496\n \n 42,581\n \n 35,213\n \n \n \n  \n \n Municipality of Rocky View\n (included in Calgary CMA)\n \n 34,171\n \n 29,925\n \n 23,326\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Health Care \n \n \n \n As with all Canadian provinces, Alberta provides for all citizens and residents through a \n publicly-funded health care system. Alberta became Canada's second province (after \n \n Saskatchewan\n ) to adopt a \n \n Tommy Douglas\n -style program in 1950, a precursor to the modern \n medicare system.\n \n \n \n \n \n See also: \n Health care in Canada\n \n \n Alberta's health care budget is currently $13.2 billion during the 2008-2009 fiscal year (aproximately 36% of all government spending), making it the most well funded health care system per-capita in Canada. Every hour more than $1.5 million is spent on health care in the province.\n \n \n Currently, 6% of the province's health care is funded by a monthy insurance premium of $44 per person or $88 per family (with exceptions on senior citizens, minors, students, and low-income earners). These fees are to be eliminated as of January 1, 2009.\n \n \n A highly-educated population and burgeoning economy have made Alberta a national leader in health education, research, and resources. Many notable facilities include the \n \n University of Alberta Hospital\n  complex, the \n Royal Alexandra Hospital, the \n Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, the Lois Hole Hospital for Women, the \n Stollery Children's Hospital, the Alberta Diabetes Institute, the Cross Cancer Institute, and the Rexall Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research in \n \n Edmonton\n . \n \n Calgary\n  is also host to the \n \n Foothills Medical Centre\n , the \n \n \n \n \n \n Peter Lougheed Centre\n \n \n \n \n , and the \n \n Alberta Children's Hospital\n .\n \n \n Currently under construction in \n \n Edmonton\n  is the new $909 million \n Edmonton Clinic, which will provide a similar research, education, and care environment as the \n \n Mayo Clinic\n  in the \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n United States\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n .\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Health Care in Alberta is administered by the unified Alberta Health Services Board. Prior to July 1, 2008 Alberta was divided into nine \n health regions: \n \n \n Aspen Regional Health Authority\n \n : \n \n \n Calgary Health Region\n \n , \n \n \n Capital Health\n \n  (Edmonton), \n \n \n Chinook Health\n \n , \n \n \n David Thompson Regional Health Authority\n \n , \n \n \n East Central Health\n \n , \n \n \n Northern Lights Health Region\n \n , \n \n \n Palliser Health Region\n \n  and \n \n \n Peace Country Health Region\n \n .\n \n \n \n \n  Education \n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n Education in Alberta\n \n As with any Canadian province, the Alberta Legislature has (almost) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905 the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and/or regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling).\n \n \n \n Heritage Hall at \n \n SAIT Polytechnic\n .\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Elementary schools\n \n \n \n There are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions. Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a \n \n \n Roman Catholic\n \n  electorate, and one (\n \n St. Albert\n ) has a \n Protestant electorate. In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St. Paul Education Region. The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law.\n \n \n For many years the \n provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K\u201312 education. Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property, as supplementary support for local education. In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards. Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K\u201312 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K\u201312 education provided by school boards. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities.\n \n \n \n Public and separate school boards, \n charter schools, and \n private schools all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education). Home schoolers may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies.  Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education.\n \n \n \n \n Universities\n \n \n \n \n \n \n St. Joseph's College at \n \n University of Alberta\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Alberta's oldest and largest university is Edmonton's \n \n University of Alberta\n  established in 1908. The \n \n University of Calgary\n , once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second largest university in Alberta. There is also \n \n Athabasca University\n , which focuses on distance learning, and the \n \n University of Lethbridge\n . There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, \n \n Northern Alberta Institute of Technology\n  and \n Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.32   There is also a large and active private sector of post-secondary institutions, including \n \n DeVry University\n . Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions. There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers). In 2005, Premier Ralph Klein made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs.33  So far, no plan has been released by the government of Alberta.\n \n \n \n \n \n  Culture \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: \n Culture of Alberta\n \n Summer brings many festivals to the province of Alberta. The \n Edmonton Fringe Festival is the world's  second largest after \n \n Edinburgh\n 's. The Folk music festivals in both Calgary and Edmonton are two of Canada's largest and both cities host a number of annual multicultural events. With a large number of summer and winter events, Edmonton prides itself as being the \"Festival City\". The city's \n \n \n \n \"heritage days\" festival\n \n \n  sees the participation of over 70 national groups. Calgary is also home to \n Carifest, the second largest Caribbean festival in the nation (after \n Caribana in \n \n Toronto\n ). The city is also famous for its \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Calgary Stampede\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n , dubbed \"The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth.\" The Stampede is Canada's biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions, such as \n calf roping and \n bull riding. In line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique Alberta western heritage crafts. The \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Banff Centre\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  also hosts a range of festivals and other events including the internationally known \n Mountain Film Festival.   These cultural events in Alberta highlight the province's cultural diversity and love of entertainment. Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmonton's Arts Barns and the \n \n Francis Winspear Centre for Music\n .\n \n \n \n \n \n See also: \n Festivals in Alberta\n \n \n Both Calgary and Edmonton are home to \n \n Canadian Football League\n  and \n \n National Hockey League\n  teams. \n Soccer, \n rugby union and \n lacrosse are also played professionally in Alberta.\n \n \n \n \n  Ecology \n \n \n \n  Flora \n \n \n In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring brings the prairie crocus \n anemone, the \n three flowered avens, \n golden bean, and other early flowers. The advancing summer introduces many flowers of the \n sunflower family, until in August the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple. The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by a short, nutritious grass, which dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the \n prairie coneflower, \n fleabane, and \n sage. Both yellow and white \n sweet clover fill the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents. The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely \n deciduous, typically \n aspen, \n poplar, and \n willow. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometres. \n Aspen poplar, \n balsam poplar (or \n cottonwood), and \n paper birch are the primary large deciduous species. \n Conifers include \n Jack pine, Rocky Mountain pine, \n Lodgepole pine, both white and black \n spruce, and the deciduous conifer \n tamarack.\n \n \n \n \n  Fauna \n \n \n The three climatic regions (\n alpine, forest, and prairie) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the land of the bison, its grasses providing a great pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a strong comeback and thrive on farms and in parks all over Alberta.\n \n \n \n \n \n The \n Bighorn Sheep is Alberta's provincial animal\n \n \n \n Alberta is home to many large \n carnivores. Among them are the \n grizzly and \n black bears, which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the \n \n \n \n \n canine\n \n \n \n  and \n feline families include \n coyotes, \n wolves, \n fox, \n lynx, \n bobcat and \n mountain lion (cougar).\n \n \n \n Herbivorous animals are found throughout the province. \n Moose, \n mule deer, and \n white-tail deer are found in the wooded regions, and \n pronghorn can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. \n Bighorn sheep and \n mountain goats live in the Rocky Mountains. \n Rabbits, \n porcupines, \n skunks, \n squirrels and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is home to only one variety of \n venomous snake, the prairie \n rattlesnake.\n \n \n Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of \n ducks, \n geese, \n swans and \n pelicans arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. \n Eagles, \n hawks, \n owls and \n crows are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other \n temperate regions, is home to \n mosquitoes, \n flies, \n wasps, and bees. Rivers and lakes are well stocked with \n pike, \n walleye, \n whitefish, \n rainbow, \n speckled, and \n brown \n trout, and even \n sturgeon. \n Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. \n Frogs and \n salamanders are a few of the \n amphibians that make their homes in Alberta.\n \n \n Alberta is the only province in Canada as well as one of the few places in the world which is free of \n Norwegian rats.34 Since the early 1950s, the government of Alberta has operated a rat-control program which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail. In 2006, Alberta Agriculture reports zero findings of wild rats; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats which have been seized from their owners. It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description; the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos, universities and colleges, and recognized research institutions.\n \n \n \n \n \n  See also \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Alberta Advantage\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Alberta Separatism\n \n \n  \n Higher education in Alberta\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Notes \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Statistics Canada\u2014CMA population estimates\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Statistics Canada\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  (February 2005). \"\n Land and freshwater area, by province and territory\".

The ancient Greek word for an actor,  (hypokrites), means literally \"one who interprets\";1 in this sense, an actor is one who interprets a dramatic \n character.2\n \n \n \n  Terminology \n \n \n The word actor refers to one who acts, while actress refers specifically to a female who acts.  The \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Oxford English Dictionary\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  states that originally \"'actor' was used for both sexes\".  The English word actress does not derive from the Latin actrix, probably not even by way of French actrice; according to the Oxford English Dictionary, actress was \"probably formed independently\" in English.  As actress is a specifically feminine word, some \n feminists assert that the word is sexist.  Gender-neutral usage of actor has re-emerged in modern English,3 especially when referring to male and female performers collectively, but actress remains a commonly used word.\n \n \n The gender-neutral term player was common in film in the early days of the \n Production Code, but is now generally deemed archaic. However, it remains in use in the theatre, often incorporated into the name of a theatre group or company (such as the \n \n East West Players\n ).\n \n \n \n \n  History\n \n \n \n \n \n Two actors performing during a theatric \n \n \n \n \n \n \n play\n \n \n \n \n \n .\n \n \n \n The first recorded case of an actor performing took place in 534 BC (probably on 23 November, though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly) when the \n \n Greek\n  performer \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Thespis\n \n \n \n \n \n  stepped on to the stage at the Theatre Dionysus and became the first known person to speak words as a character in a play or story. Prior to Thespis' act, stories were only known to be told in \n song and dance and in \n third person narrative. In honour of Thespis,a 6th century B.C poet, actors are commonly called Thespians. Theatrical legend to this day maintains that Thespis exists as a mischievous spirit, and disasters in the theatre are sometimes blamed on his \n ghostly intervention.\n \n \n Actors were traditionally not people of high status, and in the \n Early Middle Ages travelling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust. In many parts of Europe, actors could not even receive a Christian burial, and traditional beliefs of the region and time period held that this left any actor forever condemned and many actors were believed to be homosexual. However, this negative perception was largely reversed in the 19th and 20th centuries as acting has become an honored and popular profession and art. Part of the cause is the easier popular access to dramatic film entertainment and the resulting rise of the \n movie star as regards both their social status and the salaries they command. The combination of public presence and wealth has profoundly rehabilitated their image.\n \n \n In the past, only men could become actors in some societies. In the ancient Greece and Rome 4 and the \n medieval world, it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on the stage, and this belief continued right up until the 17th century, when in \n \n Venice\n  it was broken. In the time of \n \n \n \n \n \n William Shakespeare\n \n \n \n \n , women's roles were generally played by men or boys. The British prohibition(Victor Andersen) was ended in the reign of \n \n \n Charles II\n \n  who enjoyed watching female actors (actresses) on stage.\n \n \n \n \n  Techniques \n \n \n \n  As opposite sex \n \n \n Historically, acting was considered a man's profession; so, in Shakespeare's time, for instance, men and boys played all roles, including the female parts. However when an eighteen year \n Puritan prohibition of \n drama was lifted after the \n English Restoration of 1660, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n women\n \n \n \n \n \n  began to appear on stage. The first occurrence of the term actress in the \n OED being by \n \n \n \n \n Dryden\n \n \n \n  in 1700.\n \n \n In \n Japan, men (\n onnagata) took over the female roles in \n kabuki theatre when women were banned from performing on stage during the \n Edo period. However, some forms of \n Chinese drama have women playing all the roles.\n \n \n In modern times, women sometimes play the roles of \n prepubescent boys.  The stage role of \n \n \n Peter Pan\n \n , for example, is traditionally played by a woman, as are the \n principal boy and \n dame in British \n pantomime.  This is uncommon in film, however, except in \n animated films and television programmes, where boys are sometimes voiced by women.  For example, in \n \n The Simpsons\n  the voice of \n \n \n Bart Simpson\n \n  is provided by \n Nancy Cartwright. \n Opera has several \"\n pants roles\" traditionally sung by women, usually \n mezzo-sopranos. Examples are Hansel in \n H\u00e4nsel und Gretel, and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Cherubino\n \n \n \n \n \n  in \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Marriage of Figaro\n \n \n \n \n \n .\n \n \n Having an actor dress as the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long standing tradition in comic theatre and film. Most of Shakespeare's comedies include instances of overt \n cross-dressing, such as \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Francis Flute\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  in \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A Midsummer Night's Dream\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n .  The movie \n \n A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\n  stars \n \n Jack Gilford\n  dressing as a young bride. \n \n \n Tony Curtis\n \n  and \n \n \n \n \n Jack Lemmon\n \n \n \n  famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the \n \n \n Billy Wilder\n \n  film \n \n Some Like It Hot\n . Cross-dressing for comic effect was a frequently used device in most of the thirty \n \n Carry On films\n .  \n Dustin Hoffman and \n \n \n Robin Williams\n \n  each appeared in a hit comedy film in which they played most scenes dressed as a woman.  \n \n \n Several roles in modern plays and musicals are played by a member of the opposite sex (rather than a character cross-dressing), such as the character Edna Turnblad in Hairspray   played by \n \n Divine\n  in the \n \n original film\n , \n \n Harvey Fierstein\n  in the \n \n Broadway musical\n , and \n \n \n \n John Travolta\n \n \n  in the \n \n 2007 movie musical\n . Occasionally the issue is further complicated through a woman acting as a man pretending to be a woman, like \n \n \n \n Julie Andrews\n \n \n  in \n \n Victor/Victoria\n , or a woman acting as a woman pretending to be a man, like \n \n \n Gwyneth Paltrow\n \n  in \n \n Shakespeare in Love\n .\n \n \n \n \n \n  Acting awards \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, for American film\n \n \n  \n \n Cannes Film Festival Awards\n , international French festival for world wide films and documentaries\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n Volpi Cup\n \n \n s at the \n \n Venice Film Festival\n , the oldest Film Festival in the world.\n \n \n  \n \n Golden Globe Award\n s for American film and television\n \n \n  \n \n Emmy Award\n s for American television\n \n \n  \n Genie Awards for Canadian film\n \n \n  \n Gemini Awards for Canadian television\n \n \n  \n British Academy of Film and Television Arts Award for film and television; also known as \n BAFTA\n \n \n  \n \n Tony Award\n s for the theatre (specifically, \n Broadway theatre)\n \n \n  \n European Theatre Awards for the theatre\n \n \n  \n Laurence Olivier Awards for the theatre (named in honour of actor \n Sir Laurence Olivier)\n \n \n  \n \n Screen Actors Guild\n  Awards for American actors in film and television\n \n \n  \n Indian National Film Awards for the \n Indian cinema.\n \n \n  \n \n Filmfare Awards\n  honors excellence in the Indian Film Industry (\n Bollywood) - limited to Hindi language films only.\n \n \n  \n \n Goya Awards\n  for Spanish film.\n \n \n  \n San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival Spanish film festival Celebrated in San Sebasti\u00e1n.\n \n \n  \n C\u00e9sar Awards for French film.\n \n \n  \n AFI Awards for Australian film.\n \n \n  \n Berlinale German film festival in Berlin (Golden and Silver Bear)\n \n \n  \n Piala Citra (Citra Award) for Indonesian film.\n \n \n  \n IFTA's for the Irish Film and Television\n \n \n  \n Kids Choice Awards for Nickelodeon and TV channels based on kids.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  See also \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Acting\n \n \n  \n Voice Actor\n \n \n  \n Leading actor\n \n \n  \n Supporting actor\n \n \n  \n Character actor\n \n \n  \n Bit part\n \n \n  \n Movie star\n \n \n  \n Celebrity\n \n \n \n Extra (actor)\n \n \n  \n Stunt work\n \n \n  \n List of male film actors\n \n \n  \n List of female film actors\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Method acting\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Pornographic actor\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Presentational acting and Representational acting\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n Improvisational theatre\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Film producers\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Thespis\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Vaudeville\n \n \n  \n Charisma\n \n \n  \n Q Score\n \n \n  \n Dramatis person\u00e6\n \n \n  \n List of child actors\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Further reading \n \n \n \n \n \n  An Actor Prepares by \n Konstantin Stanislavski (Theatre Arts Books, ISBN 0-87830-983-7, 1989)\n \n \n  A Dream of Passion: The Development of the Method by \n \n Lee Strasberg\n  (Plume Books, ISBN 0-452-26198-8, 1990)\n \n \n  Sanford Meisner on Acting by \n \n Sanford Meisner\n  (Vintage, ISBN 0-394-75059-4, 1987)\n \n \n  Letters to a Young Actor by \n \n \n \n \n \n Robert Brustein\n \n \n \n \n  (Basic Books, ISBN 0-465-00806-2, 2005).\n \n \n  The Alexander Technique Manual by \n Richard Brennan (Connections Book Publishing ISBN 1-85906-163-X, 2004)\n \n \n  The Empty Space by \n \n \n Peter Brook\n \n \n \n \n  The Technique of Acting by \n \n Stella Adler\n \n \n \n  Acting Power by \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Robert Cohen\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n , (McGraw-Hill, 1987)\n \n \n  Acting Professionally: Raw Facts About Careers in Acting by  Robert Cohen (2003).

The intrusive \"th\" is most likely due to a \n false cognate with the Greek \u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (arithmos) meaning \"number\".\n \n \n \n \n  Why algorithms are necessary: an informal definition \n \n \n \n No generally accepted formal definition of \"algorithm\" exists yet. \n \n \n An informal definition could be \"an algorithm is a computer program that calculates something.\" For some people, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually. For others,  a program is only an algorithm if it stops before a given number of calculation steps.\n \n \n A prototypical example of an \"algorithm\" is Euclid's algorithm to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers greater than one: \"subtract the smaller number from the larger one; repeat until you get a zero or a one.\" This procedure is known to stop always and the number of subtractions needed is always smaller than the larger of the two numbers.\n \n \n We can derive clues to the issues involved and an informal meaning of the word from the following quotation from \n Boolos   Jeffrey (1974, 1999) (boldface added):\n \n \n No human being can write fast enough or long enough or small enough to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation. But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give explicit instructions for determining the nth member of the set, for arbitrary finite n. Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which they could be followed by a computing machine, or by a human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols  (\n Boolos   Jeffrey 1974, 1999, p. 19)\n \n \n The words \"enumerably infinite\" mean \"countable using integers perhaps extending to infinity.\" Thus Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that \"creates\" output integers from an arbitrary \"input\" integer or integers that, in theory, can be chosen from 0 to infinity. Thus we might expect an algorithm to be an algebraic equation such as y = m + n \u2014 two arbitrary \"input variables\" m and n that produce an output y. As we see in \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Algorithm characterizations\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \u2014 the word algorithm implies much more than this, something on the order of (for our addition example):\n \n \n Precise instructions (in language understood by \"the computer\") for a \"fast, efficient, good\" process that specifies the \"moves\" of \"the computer\" (machine or human, equipped with the necessary internally-contained information and capabilities) to find, decode, and then munch arbitrary input integers/symbols m and n, symbols + and = ... and (reliably, correctly, \"effectively\") produce, in a \"reasonable\" \n time, output-integer y at a specified place and in a specified format.\n \n \n The concept of algorithm is also used to define the notion of \n decidability. That notion is central for explaining how \n formal systems come into being starting from a small set of \n axioms and rules. In \n logic, the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related with our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of algorithm that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.\n \n \n \n \n For a detailed presentation of the various points of view around the definition of \"algorithm\" see \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Algorithm characterizations\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n . For examples of simple addition algorithms specified in the detailed manner described in \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Algorithm characterizations\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n , see \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Algorithm examples\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n .\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Formalization of algorithms \n \n \n \n Algorithms are essential to the way \n computers process information.  Many \n computer programs contain algorithms that specify the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees' paychecks or printing students' report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a \n Turing-complete system. Authors who assert this thesis include Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):\n \n \n ...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine (Gurevich 2000:1)...according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing machine. (Gurevich 2000:3)\n \n \n Typically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data is read from an input source, written to an output device, and/or stored for further processing. Stored data is regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more \n data structures.\n \n \n For any such computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise. That is, any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).\n \n \n Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation will always be critical to the functioning of the algorithm. Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting \"from the top\" and going \"down to the bottom\", an idea that is described more formally by \n flow of control.\n \n \n So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of \n imperative programming. This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, \"mechanical\" means. Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the \n assignment operation, setting the value of a variable. It derives from the intuition of \"\n memory\" as a scratchpad. There is an example below of such an assignment.\n \n \n For some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see \n functional programming and \n logic programming .\n \n \n \n  Termination \n \n \n Some writers restrict the definition of algorithm to procedures that eventually finish. In such a category Kleene places the \"decision procedure or decision method or algorithm for the question\" (Kleene 1952:136). Others, including Kleene, include procedures that could run forever without stopping; such a procedure has been called a \"computational method\" (Knuth 1997:5) or \"calculation procedure or algorithm\" (Kleene 1952:137); however, Kleene notes that such a method must eventually exhibit \"some object\" (Kleene 1952:137).\n \n \n Minsky makes the pertinent observation, in regards to determining whether an algorithm will eventually terminate (from a particular starting state):\n But if the length of the process is not known in advance, then \"trying\" it may not be decisive, because if the process does go on forever \u2014 then at no time will we ever be sure of the answer (Minsky 1967:105).\n \n \n As it happens, no other method can do any better, as was shown by \n \n \n Alan Turing\n \n  with his celebrated result on the undecidability of the so-called \n halting problem. There is no algorithmic procedure for determining of arbitrary algorithms whether or not they terminate from given starting states. The analysis of algorithms for their likelihood of termination is called \n termination analysis.\n \n \n See the examples of (im-)\"proper\" subtraction at \n partial function for more about what can happen when an algorithm fails for certain of its input numbers \u2014 e.g., (i) non-termination, (ii) production of \"junk\" (output in the wrong format to be considered a number) or no number(s) at all (halt ends the computation with no output), (iii) wrong number(s), or (iv) a combination of these. Kleene proposed that the production of \"junk\" or failure to produce a number is solved by having the algorithm detect these instances and produce e.g., an error message (he suggested \"0\"), or preferably, force the algorithm into an endless loop (Kleene 1952:322). Davis does this to his subtraction algorithm \u2014 he fixes his algorithm in a second example so that it is proper subtraction (Davis 1958:12-15). Along with the logical outcomes \"true\" and \"false\" Kleene also proposes the use of a third logical symbol \"u\" \u2014 undecided (Kleene 1952:326) \u2014 thus an algorithm will always produce something when confronted with a \"proposition\". The problem of wrong answers must be solved with an independent \"proof\" of the algorithm e.g., using induction:\n We normally require auxiliary evidence for this (that the algorithm correctly defines a \n mu recursive function), e.g., in the form of an inductive proof that, for each argument value, the computation terminates with a unique value (Minsky 1967:186).\n \n \n \n \n  Expressing algorithms \n \n \n Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including \n natural languages, \n pseudocode, \n flowcharts, and \n programming languages. Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode and flowcharts are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements, while remaining independent of a particular implementation language. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a \n computer, but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.\n \n \n There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given \n \n \n \n Turing machine\n \n \n  program as a sequence of machine tables (see more at \n finite state machine and \n state transition table), as flowcharts (see more at \n state diagram), or as a form of rudimentary \n machine code or \n assembly code called \"sets of quadruples\" (see more at \n \n \n \n Turing machine\n \n \n ). \n \n \n Sometimes it is helpful in the description of an algorithm to supplement small \"flow charts\" (state diagrams) with natural-language and/or arithmetic expressions written inside \"\n block diagrams\" to summarize what the \"flow charts\" are accomplishing. \n \n \n Representations of algorithms are generally classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description (Sipser 2006:157):\n \n \n \n 1 High-level description:\n \n \n  \"...prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head\"\n \n \n 2 Implementation description:\n \n \n  \"...prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level we do not give details of states or transition function\"\n \n \n 3 Formal description:\n \n \n  Most detailed, \"lowest level\", gives the Turing machine's \"state table\".\n \n \n \n \n \n \n For an example of the simple algorithm \"Add m+n\" described in all three levels see \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Algorithm examples\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n .\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Implementation \n \n \n Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as \n computer programs. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a biological \n neural network (for example, the \n human brain implementing \n arithmetic or an insect looking for food), in an \n electrical circuit, or in a mechanical device.\n \n \n \n \n \n  Example \n \n \n One of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in an (unsorted) list of numbers. The solution necessarily requires looking at every number in the list, but only once at each. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in a high-level description English prose, as:\n \n \n High-level description:\n \n \n \n  Assume the first item is largest.\n \n \n  Look at each of the remaining items in the list and if it is larger than the largest item so far, make a note of it.\n \n \n  The last noted item is the largest in the list when the process is complete.\n \n \n \n \n (Quasi-)formal description:\n Written in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in \n pseudocode or \n pidgin code:\n \n \n \n Algorithm LargestNumber\n Input: A non-empty list of numbers L.\n Output: The largest number in the list L.\n \n \n largest \u2190 L0\n for each item in the list L\u22651, do\n if the item  gt; largest, then\n largest \u2190 the item\n return largest\n \n \n \n \n \n \" larr;\" is a loose shorthand for \"changes to\".  For instance, \"largest  larr; item\" means that the value of largest changes to the value of item.\n \n \n \"return\" terminates the algorithm and outputs the value that follows.\n \n \n \n \n \n For a more complex example of an algorithm, see \n Euclid's algorithm for the \n greatest common divisor, one of the earliest algorithms known.\n \n \n \n  Algorithm analysis \n \n \n As it happens, it is important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the \n analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers; for example, the algorithm above has a time requirement of O(n), using the \n big O notation with n as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore it is said to have a space requirement of O(1), if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O (log n) if it is counted. \n \n \n Different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or effort than others. For example, given two different recipes for making potato salad, one may have peel the potato before boil the potato while the other presents the steps in the reverse order, yet they both call for these steps to be repeated for all potatoes and end when the potato salad is ready to be eaten. \n \n \n The \n analysis and study of algorithms is a discipline of \n computer science, and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific \n programming language or implementation. In this sense, algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation. Usually \n pseudocode is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation.\n \n \n \n \n \n  Classes \n \n \n There are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits.\n \n \n \n  Classification by implementation \n \n \n One way to classify algorithms is by implementation means.\n \n \n \n \n \n  Recursion or iteration: A \n recursive algorithm is one that invokes (makes reference to) itself repeatedly until a certain condition matches, which is a method common to \n functional programming. \n Iterative algorithms use repetitive constructs like \n loops and sometimes additional data structures like \n stacks to solve the given problems. Some problems are naturally suited for one implementation or the other. For example, \n towers of hanoi is well understood in recursive implementation. Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or less complex) iterative version, and vice versa.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Logical: An algorithm may be viewed as controlled \n logical deduction. This notion may be expressed as: Algorithm = logic + control (Kowalski 1979). The logic component expresses the axioms that may be used in the computation and the control component determines the way in which deduction is applied to the axioms. This is the basis for the \n logic programming paradigm. In pure logic programming languages the control component is fixed and algorithms are specified by supplying only the logic component. The appeal of this approach is the elegant \n \n \n semantics\n \n : a change in the axioms has a well defined change in the algorithm.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Serial or parallel or distributed: Algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time. Those computers are sometimes called serial computers. An algorithm designed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm, as opposed to \n parallel algorithms or \n distributed algorithms. Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time, whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with a \n network. Parallel or distributed algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and collect the results back together. The resource consumption in such algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors. Sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable. Some problems have no parallel algorithms, and are called inherently serial problems.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Deterministic or non-deterministic: \n Deterministic algorithms solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm whereas \n non-deterministic algorithm solve problems via guessing although typical guesses are made more accurate through the use of \n heuristics.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Exact or approximate: While many algorithms reach an exact solution, \n approximation algorithms seek an approximation that is close to the true solution. Approximation may use either a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Classification by design paradigm \n \n \n Another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories will include many different types of algorithms. Some commonly found paradigms include:\n \n \n \n \n \n  Divide and conquer. A \n divide and conquer algorithm repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem (usually \n recursively), until the instances are small enough to solve easily. One such example of divide and conquer is \n merge sorting. Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in conquer phase by merging them. A simpler variant of divide and conquer is called decrease and conquer algorithm, that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem. Divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so conquer stage will be more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms. An example of decrease and conquer algorithm is \n binary search algorithm.\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Dynamic programming\n \n \n \n \n \n \n . When a problem shows \n optimal substructure, meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems, and \n overlapping subproblems, meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called dynamic programming avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed. For example, the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted \n graph can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and \n memoization go together. The main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is that subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer, whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming. The difference between dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not a solution for all complex problems. By using memoization or maintaining a \n \n \n \n \n table\n \n \n \n  of subproblems already solved, dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity.\n \n \n  The greedy method. A \n greedy algorithm is similar to a \n dynamic programming algorithm, but the difference is that solutions to the subproblems do not have to be known at each stage; instead a \"greedy\" choice can be made of what looks best for the moment. The greedy method extends the solution with the best possible decision (not all feasible decisions) at an algorithmic stage based on the current local optimum and the best decision (not all possible decisions) made in previous stage. It is not exhaustive, and does not give accurate answer to many problems. But when it works, it will be the fastest method. The most popular greedy algorithm is finding the minimal spanning tree as given by \n Kruskal.\n \n \n  Linear programming. When solving a problem using \n linear programming, specific \n inequalities involving the inputs are found and then an attempt is made to maximize (or minimize) some linear function of the inputs. Many problems (such as the \n maximum flow for directed \n graphs) can be stated in a linear programming way, and then be solved by a 'generic' algorithm such as the \n simplex algorithm. A more complex variant of linear programming is called integer programming, where the solution space is restricted to the \n integers.\n \n \n  \n Reduction. This technique involves solving a difficult problem by transforming it into a better known problem for which we have (hopefully) \n asymptotically optimal algorithms. The goal is to find a reducing algorithm whose \n complexity is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithm's. For example, one \n selection algorithm for finding the median in an unsorted list involves first sorting the list (the expensive portion) and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion).  This technique is also known as transform and conquer.\n \n \n  Search and enumeration. Many problems (such as playing \n chess) can be modeled as problems on \n graphs. A \n graph exploration algorithm specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems. This category also includes \n search algorithms, \n branch and bound enumeration and \n backtracking.\n \n \n  The probabilistic and heuristic paradigm. Algorithms belonging to this class fit the definition of an algorithm more loosely.\n \n \n  \n Probabilistic algorithms are those that make some choices randomly (or pseudo-randomly); for some problems, it can in fact be proven that the fastest solutions must involve some \n randomness.\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Genetic algorithm\n \n \n \n \n \n \n s attempt to find solutions to problems by mimicking biological \n evolutionary processes, with a cycle of random mutations yielding successive generations of \"solutions\". Thus, they emulate reproduction and \"survival of the fittest\". In \n genetic programming, this approach is extended to algorithms, by regarding the algorithm itself as a \"solution\" to a problem.\n \n \n  \n Heuristic algorithms, whose general purpose is not to find an optimal solution, but an approximate solution where the time or resources are limited. They are not practical to find perfect solutions. An example of this would be \n local search, \n tabu search, or \n simulated annealing algorithms, a class of heuristic probabilistic algorithms that vary the solution of a problem by a random amount. The name \"\n simulated annealing\" alludes to the metallurgic term meaning the heating and cooling of metal to achieve freedom from defects. The purpose of the random variance is to find close to globally optimal solutions rather than simply locally optimal ones, the idea being that the random element will be decreased as the algorithm settles down to a solution.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Classification by field of study \n \n \n \n \n \n See also: \n List of algorithms\n \n Every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are \n search algorithms, \n sorting algorithms, \n merge algorithms, \n numerical algorithms, \n graph algorithms, \n string algorithms, \n computational geometric algorithms, \n combinatorial algorithms, \n machine learning, \n cryptography, \n data compression algorithms and \n parsing techniques.\n \n \n Fields tend to overlap with each other, and algorithm advances in one field may improve those of other, sometimes completely unrelated, fields. For example, dynamic programming was originally invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry, but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields.\n \n \n \n \n  Classification by complexity \n \n \n \n \n \n See also: \n Complexity class and \n  Parameterized Complexity\n \n Algorithms can be classified by the amount of time they need to complete compared to their input size. There is a wide variety: some algorithms complete in linear time relative to input size, some do so in an exponential amount of time or even worse, and some never halt. Additionally, some problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity, while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms. There are also mappings from some problems to other problems. Owing to this, it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them.\n \n \n \n \n  Classification by computing power \n \n \n \n Another way to classify algorithms is by computing power. This is typically done by considering some collection (class) of algorithms. A recursive class of algorithms is one that includes algorithms for all Turing computable functions. Looking at classes of algorithms allows for the possibility of restricting the available computational resources (time and memory) used in a computation. A subrecursive class of algorithms is one in which not all Turing computable functions can be obtained. For example, the algorithms that run in \n \n \n \n polynomial time\n \n \n  suffice for many important types of computation but do not exhaust all Turing computable functions. The class of algorithms implemented by \n primitive recursive functions is another subrecursive class. \n \n \n Burgin (2005, p. 24) uses a generalized definition of algorithms that relaxes the common requirement that the output of the algorithm that computes a function must be determined after a finite number of steps.  He defines a super-recursive class of algorithms as \"a class of algorithms in which it is possible to compute functions not computable by any Turing machine\" (Burgin 2005, p. 107). This is closely related to the study of methods of \n hypercomputation.\n \n \n \n \n \n  Legal issues \n \n \n \n \n See also: \n Software patents for a general overview of the patentability of software, including computer-implemented algorithms.\n \n \n Algorithms, by themselves, are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals do not constitute \"processes\" (USPTO 2006) and hence algorithms are not patentable (as in \n Gottschalk v. Benson). However, practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in \n Diamond v. Diehr, the application of a simple \n feedback algorithm to aid in the curing of \n synthetic rubber was deemed patentable. The \n patenting of software is highly controversial, and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms, especially \n data compression algorithms, such as \n \n Unisys\n ' \n \n LZW patent\n . \n \n \n Additionally, some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions (see \n export of cryptography).\n \n \n \n \n  History: Development of the notion of \"algorithm\" \n \n \n \n  Origin of the word \n \n \n \n \n \n \n See also: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Timeline of algorithms\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The word algorithm comes from the name of the 9th century \n Persian mathematician \n Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi whose works introduced Indian numerals and algebraic concepts. He worked in \n \n Baghdad\n  at the time when it was the centre of scientific studies and trade. The word \n algorism originally referred only to the rules of performing \n arithmetic using \n Arabic numerals but evolved via European Latin translation of al-Khwarizmi's name into algorithm by the 18th century. The word evolved to include all definite procedures for solving problems or performing tasks.\n \n \n \n \n  Discrete and distinguishable symbols \n \n \n \n Tally-marks: To keep track of their flocks, their sacks of grain and their money the ancients used tallying: accumulating stones  or marks scratched on sticks, or making discrete symbols in clay.

By the mid-1800s the \n telegraph, the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world, its discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as \"dots and dashes\" a common sound. By the late 1800s the \n ticker tape (ca 1870s) was in use, as was the use of \n Hollerith cards in the 1890 U.S. census.

When the tinkering was over, Stibitz had constructed a binary adding device\". (Valley News, p. 13).\n \n \n Davis (2000) observes the particular importance of the electromechanical relay (with its two \"binary states\" open and closed):\n \n \n  It was only with the development, beginning in the 1930s, of electromechanical calculators using electrical relays, that machines were built having the scope Babbage had envisioned.\" (Davis, p. 14).\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Mathematics during the 1800s up to the mid-1900s \n \n \n Symbols and rules: In rapid succession the mathematics of \n \n George Boole\n  (1847, 1854), \n \n \n Gottlob Frege\n \n  (1879), and \n \n Giuseppe Peano\n  (1888\u20131889) reduced arithmetic to a sequence of symbols manipulated by rules. Peano's The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method (1888) was \"the first attempt at an axiomatization of mathematics in a symbolic language\" (van Heijenoort:81ff).\n \n \n But Heijenoort gives Frege (1879) this kudos: Frege's is \"perhaps the most important single work ever written in logic. ... in which we see a \" 'formula language', that is a lingua characterica, a language written with special symbols, \"for pure thought\", that is, free from rhetorical embellishments ... constructed from specific symbols that are manipulated according to definite rules\" (van Heijenoort:1). The work of Frege was further simplified and amplified by \n \n \n Alfred North Whitehead\n \n  and \n \n \n Bertrand Russell\n \n  in their \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Principia Mathematica\n \n \n \n \n \n  (1910\u20131913).\n \n \n The paradoxes: At the same time a number of disturbing paradoxes appeared in the literature, in particular the \n \n \n \n \n \n Burali-Forti paradox\n \n \n \n \n  (1897), the \n Russell paradox (1902\u201303), and the \n Richard Paradox (Dixon 1906, cf Kleene 1952:36\u201340). The resultant considerations led to \n Kurt G\u00f6del's paper (1931) \u2014 he specifically cites the paradox of the liar \u2014 that completely reduces rules of \n recursion to numbers. \n \n \n Effective calculability: In an effort to solve the \n Entscheidungsproblem defined precisely by Hilbert in 1928, mathematicians first set about to define what was meant by an \"effective method\" or \"effective calculation\" or \"effective calculability\" (i.e., a calculation that would succeed). In rapid succession the following appeared: \n \n Alonzo Church\n , \n Stephen Kleene and \n J.B. Rosser's \n \u03bb-calculus, (cf footnote in \n \n Alonzo Church\n  1936a:90, 1936b:110) a finely-honed definition of \"general recursion\" from the work of G\u00f6del acting on suggestions of \n \n \n \n \n \n Jacques Herbrand\n \n \n \n \n  (cf G\u00f6del's Princeton lectures of 1934) and subsequent simplifications by Kleene (1935-6:237ff, 1943:255ff). Church's proof (1936:88ff) that the \n Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable, \n Emil Post's definition of effective calculability as a worker mindlessly following a list of instructions to move left or right through a sequence of rooms and while there either mark or erase a paper or observe the paper and make a yes-no decision about the next instruction (cf \"Formulation I\", Post 1936:289-290). \n \n \n Alan Turing\n \n 's proof of that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable by use of his \"a- [automatic-] machine\"(Turing 1936-7:116ff) -- in effect almost identical to Post's \"formulation\", \n \n J. Barkley Rosser\n 's definition of \"effective method\" in terms of \"a machine\" (Rosser 1939:226). \n S. C. Kleene's proposal of a precursor to \"\n Church thesis\" that he called \"Thesis I\" (Kleene 1943:273\u2013274), and a few years later Kleene's renaming his Thesis \"Church's Thesis\" (Kleene 1952:300, 317) and proposing \"Turing's Thesis\" (Kleene 1952:376).\n \n \n \n \n  Emil Post (1936) and Alan Turing (1936-7, 1939)\n \n \n \n Here is a remarkable coincidence of two men not knowing each other but describing a process of men-as-computers working on computations \u2014 and they yield virtually identical definitions.\n \n \n \n Emil Post (1936) described the actions of a \"computer\" (human being) as follows:\n \n \n \"...two concepts are involved: that of a symbol space in which the work leading from problem to answer is to be carried out, and a fixed unalterable set of directions.\n \n \n His symbol space would be\n \n \n \"a two way infinite sequence of spaces or boxes... The problem solver or worker is to move and work in this symbol space, being capable of being in, and operating in but one box at a time.... a box is to admit of but two possible conditions, i.e., being empty or unmarked, and having a single mark in it, say a vertical stroke.\n \n \n \n \n \"One box is to be singled out and called the starting point. ...a specific problem is to be given in symbolic form by a finite number of boxes [i.e., INPUT] being marked with a stroke. Likewise the answer [i.e., OUTPUT] is to be given in symbolic form by such a configuration of marked boxes....\n \n \n \n \n \"A set of directions applicable to a general problem sets up a deterministic process when applied to each specific problem. This process will terminate only when it comes to the direction of type (C ) [i.e., STOP].\" (U p. 289\u2013290) See more at \n Post-Turing machine\n \n \n \n \n \n Alan Turing\n \n 's work (1936, 1939:160) preceded that of Stibitz (1937); it is unknown whether Stibitz knew of the work of Turing. Turing's biographer believed that Turing's use of a typewriter-like model derived from a youthful interest: \"Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; Mrs. Turing had a typewriter; and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'\" (Hodges, p. 96). Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy, ticker tape machines, and Teletypes we might conjecture that all were influences.\n \n \n Turing \u2014 his model of computation is now called a \n \n \n \n Turing machine\n \n \n  \u2014 begins, as did Post, with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and \"states of mind\". But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers (Turing 1936-7:116).\n \n \n \n \n \"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper. We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book....I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e., on a tape divided into squares. I shall also suppose that the number of symbols which may be printed is finite....\n \n \n \n \n \"The behavior of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his \"state of mind\" at that moment. We may suppose that there is a bound B to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe at one moment. If he wishes to observe more, he must use successive observations. We will also suppose that the number of states of mind which need be taken into account is finite...\n \n \n \n \n \"Let us imagine that the operations performed by the computer to be split up into 'simple operations' which are so elementary that it is not easy to imagine them further divided\" (Turing 1936-7:136).\n \n \n Turing's reduction yields the following:\n \n \n \n \n \"The simple operations must therefore include:\n \n ::\"(a) Changes of the symbol on one of the observed squares\n \n \n \"(b) Changes of one of the squares observed to another square within L squares of one of the previously observed squares.\n \n \"It may be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind. The most general single operation must therefore be taken to be one of the following:\n \n \n \"(A) A possible change (a) of symbol together with a possible change of state of mind.\n \n ::\"(B) A possible change (b) of observed squares, together with a possible change of state of mind\"\n \n \n \n \n \"We may now construct a machine to do the work of this computer.\" (Turing 1936-7:136)\n \n \n A few years later, Turing expanded his analysis (thesis, definition) with this forceful expression of it:\n \n \n \"A function is said to be \"effectively calculable\" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Although it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is neverthessless desirable to have some more definite, mathematical expressible definition . . . [he discusses the history of the definition pretty much as presented above with respect to G\u00f6del, Herbrand, Kleene, Church, Turing and Post] . . . We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability \u2020 with effective calculability . . . .\n \n ::\"\u2020 We shall use the expression \"computable function\" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let \"effectively calculabile\" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions.\"(Turing 1939:160)\n \n \n \n \n  J. B. Rosser (1939) and S. C. Kleene (1943) \n \n \n \n \n \n J. Barkley Rosser\n  boldly defined an 'effective [mathematical] method' in the following manner (boldface added):\n \n \n \"'Effective method' is used here in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely determined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date. [his footnote #5; see discussion immediately below]. The simplest of these to state (due to Post and Turing) says essentially that an effective method of solving certain sets of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer. All three definitions are equivalent, so it doesn't matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one.\" (Rosser 1939:225\u20136)\n \n \n Rosser's footnote #5 references the work of (1) Church and Kleene and their definition of \u03bb-definability, in particular Church's use of it in his An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory (1936); (2) Herbrand and G\u00f6del and their use of recursion in particular G\u00f6del's use in his famous paper On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I (1931); and (3) Post (1936) and Turing (1936-7) in their mechanism-models of computation.\n \n \n \n Stephen C. Kleene defined as his now-famous \"Thesis I\" known as the \n Church-Turing thesis. But he did this in the following context (boldface in original):\n \n \n \"12. Algorithmic theories... In setting up a complete algorithmic theory, what we do is to describe a procedure, performable for each set of values of the independent variables, which procedure necessarily terminates and in such manner that from the outcome we can read a definite answer, \"yes\" or \"no,\" to the question, \"is the predicate value true?\"\" (Kleene 1943:273)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  History after 1950 \n \n \n A number of efforts have been directed toward further refinement of the definition of \"algorithm\", and activity is on-going because of issues surrounding, in particular, \n foundations of mathematics (especially the \n Church-Turing Thesis) and \n philosophy of mind (especially arguments around \n artificial intelligence).
